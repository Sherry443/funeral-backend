1536116,Brit,,Jones,,2022-08-11,"<p>​</p>

<p>Brit Jones, 32, of San Antonio, TX and formerly of Camp Crook, SD, passed away<br />
unexpectedly in the early morning hours of August 11, 2022.</p>

<p>Brit Jones was born on January 14, 1990 in Rapid City, SD to Lori (Henning) Stahl<br />
and Reuben Jones III. The moment he was born, he stole the hearts of many but<br />
none more so than his &ldquo;Poppa&rdquo; John Catron and &ldquo;Nana&rdquo; Carol Catron. He was the<br />
light of their world and the apple of their eyes!</p>

<p>Brit attended and graduated in 2008 from Central High School in Rapid City, SD.<br />
After graduation, Brit attended Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, SD and<br />
graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice in 2012. Right out of college, Brit went<br />
to work in the oilfields in North Dakota. In early 2015, when he got laid off in<br />
North Dakota, he went to the oilfields in Texas where he stayed and made his<br />
home. While in Texas, he married his High School sweetheart, Lindsay Rutter on<br />
February 8, 2016. They divorced the following year but remained friends. Brit was<br />
actively living and working in the oilfields of Texas at the time of his passing.</p>

<p>It takes a village to raise a child. Brit had more than a village. He had two parents<br />
who loved him beyond measure, grandparents who spoiled him rotten and took<br />
him with them wherever they went, which is when he acquired his love of<br />
travelling, and a very special aunt (Cheryl) who loved him and cared for him as if<br />
he were her own child. All of the friends and community members who loved and<br />
spoiled him also contributed to the wonderful, kind and loving young man he<br />
became. Brit enriched our lives and it has been an absolute honor to have shared<br />
the short life of the best Son, Brother, Nephew and Friend you could have ever<br />
asked for. His contagious laugh, smile and beautiful, loving, empathetic heart and<br />
soul shined as bright as the sun. He worked hard and played hard but never<br />
missed the opportunity to help out any one at any time. Brit was the most<br />
generous and loyal soul on the planet, especially to his family, friends and people<br />
who needed help. Brit could have anyone anywhere laughing until their stomachs<br />
hurt at any given time. He was truly the best of the best.</p>

<p>Brit&rsquo;s passion was playing football from grade school through college and then he<br />
went on to play semi-pro football in Minnesota for a couple years. You could find<br />
him sporting the numbers #72, #54 and #31 (that was Poppa John&rsquo;s football<br />
number so Brit wanted it too) on every football field he played on. Brit also<br />
enjoyed buying, trading and teaching people about Crypto Currency, making and<br />
posting videos on social media, taking bubble baths, spending time at the ranch in<br />
Camp Crook and listening to music, especially his favorite song &ldquo;Neon Moon&rdquo; by<br />
Brooks &amp; Dunn. He also loved to travel and go on wild adventures with his friends,<br />
including a trip to &ldquo;Camp No Counselors&rdquo;, the Dominican Republic and Mexico.<br />
Brit was always up for a grand adventure and was always the life of the party.<br />
Every place he went, he made lifelong friends. He genuinely loved people with all<br />
his heart. Brit had a special love for Lane Frost, Stone Cold Steve Austin 3:16 and<br />
Nicholas Cage as Cameron Poe (Con Air).</p>

<p>Brit is survived by his mother Lori (Chad Moser) Stahl of Winner, SD and<br />
Carrington, ND; his father Reuben Jones III of Portage, IN; two brothers Bridger<br />
Bloom, Carrington, ND and Brayden Key, Pierre, SD; a sister Lexi Lassle, Pierre, SD;<br />
Paternal grandparents, Reuben and Mae Jones, and Doris Jones, Gary, IN; two<br />
aunts, Cheryl (Ronald) Turbiville, Camp Crook, SD and Pam (Denis) Jorgenson,<br />
Dimboola, Victoria Australia; a nephew Rylan Lassle, Pierre, SD; two cousins<br />
Zachary Jorgenson and Callie (Ty Jurgenson) Shepherd; paternal great-aunt Tina<br />
Cochran, Gary, IN and paternal great-aunt Annette Jones, Gary, IN, along with<br />
many great-great aunts and uncles as well as second and third cousins. ]<br />
He was preceded in death by his maternal grandparents, John and Carol Catron,<br />
his maternal great-aunt Mimi Kirkeby; maternal great-uncle Steven Brosch; his<br />
paternal great-grandfather Reuben Jones Sr, and his paternal great grand-mother<br />
Lizzie Mae Nichols.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To say that Chris was loved by all would be stating the obvious; and to say that Chris loved his family would be an understatement. There was nothing he held closer to his heart than the ones he loved, especially his 3 children.

1550165,Luke,Jorge,Massee,1992-11-04,2022-12-23,"<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our beautiful 30-year-old son Luke Jorge Massee of Rapid City, passed away on Friday, December 23, 2022.&nbsp; He was the best son, brother, uncle, grandson, cousin, friend, and dog dad. Luke was born on November 4, 1992, in Bismarck, ND.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Luke was passionate about many things; cooking (the spicier, the better), hiking, drawing, debating everything from politics to religion, writing songs, skateboarding, playing guitar, creating poetry, and painting.&nbsp; Luke was a graffiti artist who tagged the inside of his family garage.&nbsp; A member of the Dahl Fine Art Center was walking by, one day, and invited Luke to paint some doors at the art center after seeing his work. &ldquo;In a world of prints Luke was a Van Gough.&rdquo; And tattoos, Luke loved to get inked!&nbsp; A barcode, watercolor panda, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley&rsquo;s LOVE and a graffiti piece, that he designed, to name a few.</p>

<p>Luke had an impeccable, inappropriately hilarious sense of humor.&nbsp; He was always the light of the room and had everyone cracking up with some of the funniest, craziest jokes people ever heard. Luke did not sugarcoat anything. I wonder how many times he heard his mom say, &ldquo;Luke you cannot say that!&rdquo;&nbsp; A long-running family joke was that the Schwan&rsquo;s guy was Luke&rsquo;s Dad.&nbsp; He always loved to tell the story about going up to a random Schwan&rsquo;s guy, grabbing him and saying, &ldquo;I love you, Dad!&rdquo;&nbsp; Luke and his (real) Dad loved Far Side jokes (enough said!).</p>

<p>Luke loved nature and taking his dog, Marley, for walks.&nbsp; Hiking in the Black Hills to spots such as Sheridan Lake (for cliff jumping), the Washouts, Little Falls and the Rock Maze with friends was special to him.&nbsp; They only made a few people cry by taking them off trails!&nbsp; He could start his own rock maze by the sheer number of rocks that he has collected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Luke was a genuine bad ass, through and through.&nbsp; Luke was also a lover.&nbsp; He was protective of the ones he loved.&nbsp; He gave the best hugs.&nbsp; Family was so important to him, and he was so proud to be Isaac and Kora&rsquo;s Uncle.&nbsp; He always gave Isaac tips such as &ldquo;don&rsquo;t punch with your thumb tucked inside&rdquo; and &ldquo;always know your surroundings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kora giggled with delight when he tossed her up into the air.&nbsp; Luke and Kaley had a special connection, and he was her superhero more than once.&nbsp; Luke and Tanner loved skateboarding and snowboarding together; they pulled all-nighters playing video games. Claude will cherish the many times that they played guitar together and the hour-long phone calls that covered every topic imaginable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke was always up for burgers and beers with Mom and tried his best to teach her how to play pool. In his younger years, Luke spent many hours fishing and boating with grandparents, Uncle Jason, and cousins.</p>

<p>Claude and Karen picked Luke up this summer, and they all enjoyed a trip to Jeff &amp; Porschae Brown&rsquo;s wedding in Colorado.&nbsp; Luke was genuinely happy and honored to be Jeff&rsquo;s groomsman.&nbsp; The road trip and the Denver Aquarium were icing on the cake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Old friends are the best friends.&nbsp; Zack Guerue and Luke spent many hours skatin&rsquo; up Hot Springs and Rapid City.&nbsp; They were the underdogs who had each other&rsquo;s backs and who also shared a love of music and guitar playing. Luke and Jeff Brown had a band, 7 Foot Dart Fetcher, where they played some local gigs and spent hours skateboarding, hiking, and solving world problems.</p>

<p>Motorcycle riding through the Black Hills was always much more fun when Luke was the leader. He begrudgingly honked his horn, per mom&rsquo;s request, when going through tunnels.&nbsp; Luke was the current President of UMF, a motorcycle club.&nbsp; He was always up for a ride and enjoyed going on a few runs with his biker brothers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Luke served his country by being a wildland firefighter one season that took him from South Dakota to California to Arizona to Montana. He was so proud of this and worked very hard to accomplish it.&nbsp; Even though he loved firefighting, extended times away from home was intolerable.&nbsp; He was always humbled by the generosity of people that he met along the way.</p>

<p>Luke&rsquo;s family is forever grateful to Tamara Klein, Zack Guerue, and Kara Schumaker who spent final hours with him as Mother Nature prevented his parents from getting to him.&nbsp; Luke was treated with dignity and respect by all the staff at Monument Health Rapid City Hospital.</p>

<p>We will miss our &ldquo;Luke T Duke&rdquo; so much and will cherish our memories.&nbsp; We know that he is our very best Angel.&nbsp; Son, we love you today, tomorrow, and always.&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke is survived by his parents Claude and Karen Massee, brother Tanner Massee (Jetaime Aul), sister Kaley Massee, nephew Isaac Massee, niece Kora Massee, grandmother Kay Stevenson, step-grandmother Barbara Kraft, Uncles Jason Kraft, Mike Massee, Jerry Massee, Aunts Cody Kraft, Lynda Anderson, Gail Vanderplaats, many cousins, and his beloved dog Marley.&nbsp; He was preceded in death by grandfather Richard (Dick) Kraft, grandmother Shirley Massee, grandfather George Massee, &lsquo;Grandma Great&rsquo; Karen Stevenson and &lsquo;Grandma Kraft&rsquo; Elizabeth Kraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Services are pending for June 24, 2023, near Keystone, SD with an interment of ashes at the Kraft Family Cemetery in Carson, ND on June 25.</p>

1555458,Len,G.,Hofer,1942-01-30,2023-02-27,"<p>Piedmont, SD - Len Gottlieb Hofer of Piedmont, SD and formally of Meadow, SD died February<br />
27, 2023 at Monument Health in Rapid City.<br />
Len Gottlieb Hofer was born January 30, 1942, to Emil and Anna (Adamek) Hofer in Lemmon,<br />
S.D. He was the oldest of two brothers. Len was raised on his family&#39;s Twin Butte Ranch east of<br />
Meadow, S.D. which was settled by his grandfather in 1916. He met Darlys Lowe, and they were<br />
wed on March 12,1966. Len &amp; Darlys ranched with his parents on the Hofer family ranch until<br />
eventually taking it over. He attended Black Horse Creek and Twin Butte Country Schools. He<br />
attended Lemmon High School and finished at Brookings, S.D. School of Agriculture in 1961. He<br />
attended one week of school in Colorado with several neighbors to learn to do their own vet<br />
work. Son Doug came along in 1967 and Kim in 1970. Len loved his kids and did whatever he<br />
could do for them. Len was active in the Black Horse Saddle Club that his parents and many<br />
neighbors originated.<br />
Len and his younger, but much taller, brother Duane were very close. They both enjoyed the<br />
love of rodeo. Len rode cows in his younger years, team tie-down roped, tie-down calf roped,<br />
team roped and in the most recent years, senior men&#39;s breakaway roped, throughout his<br />
lifelong rodeo career. Len made many friends throughout the surrounding states through his<br />
love of rodeo. His good horse Bugs won Horse of the Year awards that he was very proud of. He<br />
had many horses throughout his life but loved Bugs exceptionally. Darlys held down the fort,<br />
watching cattle and doing the field work so Len could rodeo and enjoy what he loved. Len was a<br />
great roper and teacher, as Doug and Kim roped and competed. Len and Darlys were honored<br />
with being the 2022 Boss Cowman Honorees for the Lemmon, S.D. Boss Cowman Celebration.<br />
This meant so much to both of them. Len loved people, socializing, and having a good time. He<br />
had great mental, spiritual and physical strength.&nbsp;<br />
Len kept a firetruck at the ranch from the Glad Valley Fire Department.&nbsp; He was physically and<br />
mentally tough and would be gone for two days straight fighting fire if need be. He was a<br />
member and director of the Grand River Grazing Association and was proud of this. Len and<br />
Darlys were part owners of Lemmon Livestock in the 80s. Len and Darlys retired and sold the<br />
ranch in November 2011. They moved to a small acreage in Piedmont, S.D. Here they made<br />
new friends and lifelong friends would visit frequently. He became popular in the community<br />
for his willingness to help and problem solve, so neighbors frequently contacted him for<br />
support. He and Darlys transferred their membership from the Indian Creek Lutheran Church to<br />
the Piedmont Valley Lutheran Church once they moved. They were active members and Len<br />
was a director. He grew close with neighbors across the road, so with his love for socialization,<br />
he would visit frequently, enjoy baked goods and Darlys would join regularly to play<br />
cards. Friends and family liked to tease him about his discovered love of Pizza Ranch chicken<br />
drummies and their desserts.<br />
Len is survived by his wife of 57 years, Darlys Hofer; son, Doug Hofer; daughter Kim Hofer; and<br />
his grand puppy Taz that loved him so much. His brother Duane, his wife Frankie, and their<br />
daughter Krista Hofer. Duane was with his brother routinely during his hospital stay. As well as<br />
numerous extended families on both the Hofer and Lowe side of the family.</p>

1563665,Timothy,Gene,Nordquist,1957-08-27,2023-05-06,"<p>Rapid City, SD - Timothy Gene Nordquist, 65, of Rapid City, SD passed away on May 6th, 2023 at home with his family. Services will be at 6 pm Friday May 26th at his home, with music, family, and friends. Sunday May 28th, there will be another gathering in Lake City, SD at his childhood home.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rapid City - Tim was born the seventh child of James and Viola (Bagley) Nordquist on August 27, 1957. He was one of 11 children raised next to Cottonwood Lake in Lake City on the Coteau des Prairie of Marshall County. He was a man of the land, farming, hunting, fishing, and building until the day he left. He graduated from Britton High School, and then went on to SDSU getting his bachelor&#39;s degree in Agronomy. There, he met his first and only love, Dana Weischedel. They never left each other&#39;s side from that moment on. They celebrated 43 years together. Tim also had a way with words, being published in magazines with his hunting tales, and also poetry. He was an artist in landscaping and woodworking, building with his favorite medium - diamond willow harvested from his family farm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They welcomed two &ldquo;editions,&rdquo; Volume 1 - NaTasha and 2 - Dane. He taught them about all the important things in life, how to build, hunt, cook, get their homework done, and how to be good parents. He then got to add even more &ldquo;editions&rdquo; to his library: Dane&rsquo;s wife Melanie and his 3 children Keagan, Logan and Avacyn. NaTasha has 3 children, Azura, Ulysses, and Odessa. &ldquo;GRRRRRampa&rdquo; loved to share his knowledge with his grandkids and had been building a vineyard and winery with his oldest grandson Ulysses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tim and Dana opened their home to musicians and travelers from all over the world. Many nights were spent around campfires listening to guitars and fiddles. Tim was always one to volunteer any random visitor for help. Many of the features you&rsquo;ll see on the property were aided by a new friend just traveling through. He had endless stories to share, and an affinity for anyone with red hair as he had. Nobody who walked through our door left without feeling at home. We will celebrate his life with music and stories at home, and then a fish fry and spreading his ashes in Cottonwood Lake. His wish for when he left this world was &ldquo;to be fish food,&rdquo; and be back in the lake that he loved with all his heart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In lieu of flowers please come join us and pull weeds in his garden.</p>

In 1978 the family moved from Estelline SD to Moorcroft Wy in search of a better life for his family. The marriage ended in 1983 leaving John a Bachelor until the time of his death.

John retired from Eagle Butte/Belle Aire mines in Gillette Wy in the early 2000&rsquo;s. John was an accomplished equipment operator and small engine mechanic. He was the go-to guy for fixing lawn mowers in Murdo. John also loved mowing the cemetery in Murdo and enjoyed driving around Jones County checking things out. John could be found having coffee most mornings helping solve the days issues.</p>

<p>John was a faithful member of the Lutheran Church no matter where he lived.</p>

Don was an entrepreneur to his core. As a child he knocked on neighbors’ doors selling vegetables from his red wagon. Don served in the Navy during the Korean War on the destroyer, the USS Knapp. After his return, he tried his hand at many endeavors from selling seafood to carpentry. His life was positively changed after moving to Minnesota for work. His boss, recognizing a maverick, thought Don should meet his daughter, Joan. Upon hearing that she read “Time” and “Playboy”, he was intrigued and soon after meeting, he married his kindred spirit in 1961. Together they acquired real estate by purchasing and remodeling forsaken duplexes.</span></span></p><p><span style=""""font-size:11pt""""><span style=""""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"""">Fulfilling his dream of living out west, Don and Joan moved their young family to Montana in 1970. Planning to employ his carpentry skills, he quickly realized that residents of rural Montana are their own carpenters. Looking for other options to support his family, he saw a chest of drawers in a furniture store and thought that he could build one better. Don and Joan started building furniture in their garage. Expanding the business, Don and Joan moved their family to Rapid City, South Dakota in 1986. Ultimately, Don’s simple idea grew to be a national manufacturer of bedroom furniture.</span></span></p><p><span style=""""font-size:11pt""""><span style=""""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"""">Don received recognition for his quiet civic contributions. He received the North Star Award for Exceptional Support of Scouting. Mr. Kooiker, former Mayor of Rapid City, proclaimed April 21, 2012 as “Don Perdue Day”. Most recently, the Honorable Dennis Daugaard, former Governor of South Dakota, presented Don with the Rushmore Honors Award Day. With the dual goals of increasing tourism and expanding knowledge of our presidents, Don founded the City of Presidents, which is responsible for placing the bronze statues of the U.S. Presidents on our Rapid City street corners.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style=""""font-size:11pt""""><span style=""""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"""">Don’s tenacity, unconventional thinking, and hard work benefited many lives and will continue to do so into the future.</span></span></p><p><span style=""""font-size:11pt""""><span style=""""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"""">Don enjoyed sharing new experiences with his family. On his first camping trip in Montana, he stayed awake throughout the night holding a hatchet to protect his family from bear attacks. Don completed numerous woodworking projects with his grandsons, Reed and Riley, imprinting on them the value of a quality, smooth finish. On their many walks together, Don collected rocks with his granddaughter, Jaida, and zipped around the Black Hills with Rhory, his grandson, in his cherry red sports car. Don also enjoyed sailing, old cars, reading about great minds of the past, innovating, and shopping for an RV for his next great adventure.</span></span></p><p><span style=""""font-size:11pt""""><span style=""""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"""">Don is survived by his wife, Joan; children, Richard Perdue (Tracy) and Lori Stueber; grandchildren, Rhory Perdue, Jaida Fehrman (Brian), Reed Padilla (Brooke), and Riley Stueber; and sister, Diane Purcell (Norm).</span></span></p><p><span style=""""font-size:11pt""""><span style=""""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"""">A celebration of life is planned for a future date.</span></span></p>",,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/CFSV2/obituaries/photos/12123/1591368/64ea417a58273.jpg

<p><br />
Celebration of Life will be held Saturday December 16, 2023, from 11AM to 3PM, at the New Underwood<br />
Community Center.<br />
Charlie was born to Carol and Selma (Thompson) Galbreth on March 29, 1948, and was the<br />
youngest of three siblings. While growing up on a ranch just south of Reeder, ND they attended a<br />
country school which was not too far from the ranch where Selma was the teacher. Charlie graduated<br />
high school from Hettinger, ND in 1966.&nbsp; After graduation her adventures began. Horses often brought her soul a sense of peace and belonging &ndash; Charlie moved to CA and worked the stables at a show<br />
jumping facility.<br />
After coming back to the Dakota&rsquo;s, she met Steve in November of 1981 &ndash; it was love at first sight&nbsp;and she knew it. So, she tracked him down in Moorehead, MN. After a short engagement, they were&nbsp;married on May 25, 1982. She came into the marriage with her son Rob, and the following spring their&nbsp;daughter Lacey was born. Two years later they welcomed their son Seth.<br />
Charlie&rsquo;s life was filled with unexpected challenges &ndash; but one thing was for certain &ndash; Charlie&rsquo;s&nbsp;will power and perseverance to overcome life&rsquo;s obstacles with a smile on her face. In 1989, she was&nbsp;diagnosed with Breast Cancer &ndash; with the love and support of her family she overcame the battle with&nbsp;cancer. A short while later, she lost her left arm in a workplace accident. But even with an extended&nbsp;stay at the hospital &ndash; she did not slow down and was often spotted helping encourage other patients in&nbsp;their own recovery. This is when she found she had a powerful gift of helping others and she later went&nbsp;on to become a beloved Counselor.<br />
In 1992, Charlie and her family moved to the Black Hills Wild Game Ranch in Farmingdale, SD.&nbsp;Charlie worked hard to make the house a home and it was during this time at the Ranch that Charlie&nbsp;began her education to become a Counselor. In 1997 the family moved to Halstad, MN so Charlie could&nbsp;obtain her bachelor&rsquo;s degree, her master&rsquo;s degree followed in 2001. After graduation, Charlie moved to&nbsp;Douglas, WY to begin her career. She eventually moved her practice back to South Dakota. While&nbsp;Charlie particularly enjoyed working with our Military, she also helped those in marriages and trauma.<br />
Charlie enjoyed living life to the fullest and this meant building a fantastic life with Steve. One&nbsp;of her greatest accomplishments was her family. Often found together on weekends filled with laughter&nbsp;and food. She enjoyed new adventures, seeing and learning new things. Watching her grandkids activities brought joy to her heart, she could often be spotted in the stands cheering them on. To&nbsp;know Charlie was to love her. She touched every life that crossed her path, never knew a stranger and&nbsp;was the most selfless individual &ndash; often giving more love than expected. Charlie was truly the gift that kept on&nbsp;giving. Her family could not be more proud of the legacy that she has left behind, knowing the&nbsp;lives that she helped heal, save and extend &ndash; she will live on.</p>

<p>Charlie is survived by her loving husband, Steve Lindgren of Caputa; her children Lacey (Kerry)<br />
and their children Savie and Cruz Slaba of Box Elder; Seth (Jackie) Lindgren of Piedmont; Sibling : William<br />
(Colleen) Galbreth of Hettinger; Father and Mother-in-Law Richard and Rose Lindgren of Moorhead; her<br />
beloved toy aussie, Pete; and a host of other relatives and friends.</p>

<p>She is preceded in death by her parents CG (Pat) and Selma Galbreth; Brother Tom Galbreth;&nbsp;son Rob Whitehead; beloved friend Pat Tomlin.</p>

1614261,Shirley,Mae,Latham,1941-07-14,2024-01-12,"<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shirley Mae&nbsp;(Rowley)&nbsp;Latham, 82, Buffalo and formerly of Camp Crook SD, died&nbsp;on Friday, January 12, 2024&nbsp;at Monument Health in Rapid City.</p>

<p>Shirley was born on July 14,&nbsp;1941,&nbsp;at home in Belle Fourche, SD to Arlowe and Maggie (Werlinger) Rowley. Two years later she was joined by little brother Jim. She attended grade and high school in Belle Fourche before graduating with honors in May of 1959. After graduation, she attended a six-month business course&nbsp;at National College of Business in Rapid City. After&nbsp;completing&nbsp;her business&nbsp;course,&nbsp;she began working for the Butte County Register of Deeds. On May 29,&nbsp;1970,&nbsp;she married Erwin Latham and they moved to the ranch&nbsp;northeast&nbsp;of Camp Crook. Here they made a home and&nbsp;raised their&nbsp;three children Darwin, Benjamin, and CoriAnn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Darwin started school in the fall of 1972&nbsp;resulting in&nbsp;Shirley becoming&nbsp;a Camp Crook resident.&nbsp; They rented a house in town, due to road conditions not always being passable. In the fall of 1979,&nbsp;they moved to Buffalo so Darwin could attend&nbsp;high&nbsp;school. After CoriAnn&rsquo;s graduation in 1992 Shirley moved back to the ranch. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Shirley, a lifelong member of the Catholic Church, attended St. Anne&#39;s in Camp Crook. After it&#39;s closure, she attended St. Anthony&#39;s&nbsp;in Buffalo&nbsp;until her health forced her closer to medical care. Throughout her life she was involved in many&nbsp;community&nbsp;groups and activities. Those most dear to her were the American Legion Auxiliary&nbsp;Unit #147, Harding County EMT&rsquo;s, Community Action Team, Buffalo Lioness, and the Foster Grandparent Program in the school in Camp Crook. Many local kids still refer to her as Grandma Shirley.&nbsp; Shirley was very community minded and served as&nbsp;an&nbsp;officer in most&nbsp;if not all of the groups she participated in.</p>

<p>While in Buffalo she owned and managed the Buffalo Drive&nbsp;In, worked for Linda Paulson at H&amp;L Supr Value, and in 1980 and 2000 was a census taker. After moving back to the ranch,&nbsp;she REALLY enjoyed her favorite hobby of getting the juicy details when she wrote the Camp Crook news&nbsp;for local papers. Perhaps her favorite job was being Grandma and Auntie to&nbsp;all of&nbsp;her littles. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout her life Shirley did things that brought her joy. She enjoyed baking and decorating cakes. She enjoyed sewing and made teddy bears and Barbie doll clothes. She liked playing cards&nbsp;and especially&nbsp;enjoyed&nbsp;playing ND rummy and gin rummy with her dear Sister-in-Law Frankie. Reading books of all kinds was&nbsp;one of her favorite hobbies. Of course, a trip to&nbsp;Deadwood&nbsp;every&nbsp;now and then was a good time as well. In 2000,&nbsp;she was given a computer and&nbsp;instantly became&nbsp;an internet and email fan.&nbsp; She was known to family as the clicking QUEEN.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She enjoyed attending wrestling starting with Darwin&rsquo;s first match.&nbsp; This continued with Ben and her grandkids. She would often be caught cheering for a random kid because he was just so cute.&nbsp; Another thing she&nbsp;enjoyed was traveling. Whether&nbsp;it was a trip to&nbsp;CA to see Ben, GA to see Cori,&nbsp;or even a drive to Faith to pick up Joy.&nbsp;She enjoyed them all.</p>

<p>Survivors include her three children,&nbsp;Darwin (Kay) of Camp Crook, SD; Benjamin (Kate) Pacifica,&nbsp;CA; CoriAnn (Rick&nbsp;Battista) Buford,&nbsp;GA; four grandchildren, John and Jason (Kaeloni) of Camp Crook; Robert and Cara Battista of Buford, Ga.; four great grandchildren, Joy, Jaydon, Jarrett, and James T.</p>

<p>Shirley was preceded in death by her husband, Erwin Latham; parents,&nbsp;Arlowe and Maggie (Werlinger) Rowley; and brother,&nbsp;Jim Rowley.</p>

<p>A&nbsp;Vigil Service&nbsp;will be held&nbsp;Wednesday,&nbsp;Jan 17, 2024&nbsp;at 7:00 PM at St. Anthony&rsquo;s Catholic Church in Buffalo SD.&nbsp; Funeral services will be Thursday January 18 at 11:00 AM with a visitation one hour prior at the Camp Crook Area Community Center with Reverend Brian Sorensen presiding.</p>

<p>Interment will follow at the Fairview Cemetery in Camp Crook. A time of food and fellowship will follow.</p>

Jeffrey James Thorstenson was born May 22, 1971 at the Mobridge Community Hospital Mobridge, SD to James Thorstenson and Deborah (Sather) Meints. Jeff&rsquo;s early childhood was spent in Mobridge until the family moved to Aberdeen where he graduated from Aberdeen Central High School in May of 1989. It was as a young boy that Jeff along with his brothers fell in love with horses and roping.&nbsp; The boys roped every chance they had. Jeff qualified many times for state and national high school finals and also continued to rise through the amateur and professional rodeo ranks many times qualifying for the NRCA, SDRA and Badlands Circuit Finals. However nothing thrilled him more than roping with his son Jace and wife Kristie. Jeff attended Pratt, Kansas Vo Tech and Watertown Vo Tech. Jeff would also later attend auctioneers school in Mason City, Iowa. However it was always his dream to breed and train team roping horses.</p>

<p>Jeff and Kristie were married May 17th, 1995 at Rapid City, SD. Following their marriage they lived in the New Underwood area where together they began to make their dream of raising and training good horses come true. Jeff rode colts and shod a lot of horses and trained team roping horses and of course rodeoed a lot. They relocated to Cave Creek, AZ to continue their passion together and it wasn&rsquo;t long after, on August 14, 2003 when their pride and joy Jace joined their family.<br />
Jeff and Kristie purchased an unbroke 2 year old stud colt by the name of Sadies Frosty Drift and turned him into one of the best stallions in the country. Sadies was not only a very accomplished individual but was also a great sire. He could team rope, breakaway rope, and was an outstanding barrel horse often times doing all that at the same rodeo. Jeff and Kristie eventually made the hard decision to sell Sadies and he relocated to Brazil. He produced a 2016 world champion Barrel horse Sadies Famous Last Word. Jeff was also a 27 year member of the AQHA. Jeff worked many sales over the years as an auctioneer and also as a pedigree man using his vast knowledge of working horses. Jeff and Kristie also loved to host roping schools both in South Dakota and Arizona and together took in a lot of young people and mentored them in horsemanship and in the arena. Jeff and Kristie relocated to Morristown, AZ in 2020 where he continued to live until his passing. Jeff had friends all over the US through the connections that he had in the horse business.<br />
Jeff is survived by his wife of 27 years Kristie; son Jace of Morristown, AZ.; mother, Deborah Meints of Rapid City, SD; father, James Thorstenson of Fruitdale, SD; two brothers, Justin (Julie) of Dupree, SD and Jason of Wittman, AZ.; step sister, Lisa (Jim) Miller of Bismarck, ND; maternal grandmother, Bea Sather of Mobridge, SD; in-laws, Jay and Connie Price of New Underwood, SD; two brother-in-laws Clint (Nicole) Price of New Underwood, SD and Corey Price of Sturgis, SD; ten nieces and nephews, Alix (Chet) Crago, Autumn (Levi) Sanftner, Tayla, Treg, Tanner and Jett Thorstenson, Taylor, Jake, Ava and Grace Price and two great nieces, Liv and Nayvie.<br />
He was preceded in death by his grandparents Ralph and Alice Thorstenson, Mick Sather, Delbert and Lois Stinson and Stanley and Clarice Price.<br />
People often admired how much he loved his family and how he never changed, he wore the same style of shirt and jeans every day. Jeff was a man who knew who he was and was confident in it. He was also the type of guy who when you ran into him you always stayed longer than you planned to visit and he tried to make sure you left feeling happier than he found you.</p>

<p>Marvin&nbsp;Lee Heggem, born on September 23, 1954 in Spearfish, South Dakota passed away on April 3, 2024, at the age of 69 in Rapid City, South Dakota.<br />
Marvin&#39;s journey was one marked by boundless friendliness and a knack for creative solutions. His hands and inventive mind were rarely still as he was always immersed in projects that not only challenged him but also benefited those around him. Marvin&#39;s ability to fix anything endeared him to his community where he was not just a handyman but a trusted friend and neighbor. His most favorite place to encounter people and use his creativity was at Fort Hays Chuckwagon of Rapid City with Herman Jones and the Ft. Hays work family.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marvin&#39;s legacy is carried forward by his wife, Linda Heggem and their children Rebecca and Matt Schaunaman, Jeremie and Holly Fischer, and MaKinzie Heggem; their grandchildren: Tanner Schaunaman and fiance, Abby Burkhart, Layton and Kaitlyn Schaunaman Davis, Kyla, Connor, Olivia and Wayne Schaunaman, Tom Cooper, Tyler and David Fischer, and Jesse Cooper; and sibling families of Mark and Jaimie Heggem, Marcia and Mark Lermeny, and Mona Balo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marvin&#39;s life reminds us that every person we meet is an opportunity to share the gospel of Christ to make a positive impact, and every challenge we face is a chance to demonstrate our resilience and ingenuity. Let us celebrate Marvin, not with sorrow for his absence, but with gratitude for his enduring presence in the fabric of our memories.</p>

1630639,Donna,Marie,Sweeney,1958-01-12,2024-04-11,"<p>Donna Marie (Pettie) Sweeney passed away April 11, 2024, at the age of 66 after a long and brave struggle with cancer. A beautiful mother, partner, and friend to many; we will continue to honor her life by living with love, purpose, and an appreciation of all the little adventures along the way.</p><p><br></p><p>Donna leaves behind a loving partner, Tom Didier, of Rapid City, and her two children, daughter Chanda Pettie of Colorado and son, Kelsey Knudson of Wisconsin along with his two beautiful children Tula and Benton. Donna was the baby of a large family. She has two brothers, Ronnie and Billy Pettie, and four sisters: Arlene Aadland, Diana Holder, Roberta Farris, and Sharon Pettie. Her siblings Ronnie and Roberta, and her late husband James M Sweeney Jr., preceded her in death.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout life, Donna was a free spirit that loved nature and a connection to the earth. Born in Bottineau, North Dakota to Ed and Nora Pettie, she often shared childhood memories of riding horses and playing in the woods of the Turtle Mountains. This grew into a career as a horticulturist, florist, and life explorer. Her adventures were souvenired by little rocks she gathered along the way, each a memory. She often asked her loved ones to bring her the same to share their travels with her. She was adorable in her delight of small things. She loved getting cards, visiting family and friends, trying new things, and she very much loved her kitties.</p><p><br></p><p>Donna had two children with her first husband, Keith Knudson of North Dakota; a daughter Chanda Pettie and a son Kelsey Knudson. She later made the Black Hills of South Dakota her home in the early 1990’s, settling in the mining ‘ghost’ town of Galena with her late husband James Sweeney Jr. Together they made a home out of a historic cabin on a creek that provided an abundance of wildlife encounters, solitude, and memories. With the passing of her husband in 2017, she moved to Rapid City to look towards new adventures. She found that and much more with her loving partner, Tom Didier of Rapid City, where they enjoyed Harley rides through the beautiful Black Hills and gathering with friends at the Happy Tavern. Just as her life was gaining a new bloom, it was cut short by cancer. She fought to get her life back and was relieved to ‘ring of the bell’ as a milestone of successfully completing surgery, chemo and radiation treatment, only to find out that same day of a second cancer diagnosis. Her grace and perseverance for life is a reminder for us all to take a moment, to be in this moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Donna’s family would like to thank the Monument Health Cancer Care Institute and Hospice House of Rapid City for their wonderful care of Donna in her last days. Donna’s ashes will be interred alongside her late husband at the Black Hills National Cemetery in Sturgis, SD on Monday, April 15, 2024.</p>",,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/CFSV2/obituaries/photos/12123/1630639/6619c5398640c.jpg

1634286,Jaimie,Lynnette,Rivers-Chapman,1967-06-05,2024-05-23,"<p>Jaimie Lynnette Rivers-Chapman, affectionately known as Jay, a beacon of love and laughter, left this world on May 23, 2024, after a courageous battle with cancer. Born on June 5, 1967, in Kansas City, MO, Jay's warmth and creativity were evident from an early age, traits that she carried throughout her life, touching the hearts of all who knew her.</p><p><br></p><p>A proud graduate of Theodore F. Riggs Senior High School, Jay's education laid the foundation for a life characterized by hard work and dedication. She approached her various roles with a tenacity and vigor that not only supported her family but also left a lasting impact on her colleagues and community. Her involvement in local associations further highlighted her commitment to service and her desire to contribute positively to the world around her.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay's most cherished role was that of a mother and wife. She is survived by her loving husband, Jerry Chapman, and her adoring children, Gracie, Mercer, and Jacob. Jay's family was the centerpiece of her life, and she instilled in them the values of love, humor, and creativity. Her guidance was gentle yet profound, and her legacy will continue to flourish through their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who knew Jay will remember her for her love of the simple pleasures in life. She found joy in nurturing her plants, the soft glow of candles, and the beauty of a well-crafted purse. These interests were more than hobbies; they were extensions of her personality—her love for growth, her light in times of darkness, and her appreciation for the unique and handcrafted.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay's life was a tapestry woven with threads of love, laughter, and creativity. Her sense of humor was a gift that she freely shared, brightening the days of friends and strangers alike. Her creative spirit found expression not only in her interests but in the inventive ways she approached challenges and the imaginative tales she concocted for her children at bedtime.</p><p><br></p><p>As we bid farewell to Jaimie Lynnette Rivers-Chapman, we are reminded of the indelible mark she has left on our hearts. Her love was a sanctuary, her laughter a melody, and her creativity a map to a life well-lived. Though she has departed from this earthly realm, her spirit will continue to guide and inspire us.</p><p><br></p><p>A life so beautifully lived deserves to be beautifully remembered. Jay's memory will be cherished and celebrated by all who were fortunate enough to cross paths with her. She was a light in the lives of her family, a friend to many, and a cherished member of the Rapid City community where she spent her final years.</p><p><br></p><p>In honor of Jay, let us hold our loved ones close, find joy in the mundane, and approach each day with a creative spirit and a heart full of laughter. Though we mourn the loss of such a remarkable soul, we take solace in knowing that her legacy will live on through the lives she touched and the love she shared.</p><p><br></p><p>Jaimie Lynnette Rivers-Chapman's life story is one of unwavering strength, boundless affection, and an ever-present smile that will forever illuminate the memories of those she leaves behind. As we reflect on her journey, we are grateful for the time we had with her, and we celebrate the extraordinary woman she was. Rest in peace, dear Jay.

1634289,Cheryle,Lee,Slagle,1947-08-18,2024-05-25,"<p><a href=""""https://www.facebook.com/stories/101440062024742/UzpfSVNDOjk4NTI3NTM4NjIxNzQ4Mw==/?view_single=1&amp;source=shared_permalink&amp;mibextid=W9rl1R"""">Live Stream Service</a>Cheryle Lee (Smock) Slagle, 76 (born August 18, 1947), of Rapid City, SD, peacefully passed away on the morning of May 25, 2024, in Las Vegas, NV. She was comforted by loved ones that serene morning when the angels took her hand and guided her home.<br />
<br />
More than anything, Cheryle lived a delightful life as a wonderful wife, mother, aunt, grandmother, and great-grandmother. She was also a loyal friend to many. Until her health condition made it impossible, she was a bookkeeper for the family business, John Slagle Trucking. She enjoyed cooking on occasion (although she preferred, In-N-Out), loved her Monte Carlo and &rsquo;57 Chevy, enjoyed bingo nights from time to time, was an avid reader of fiction novels, radiated in the color purple, lived &amp; breathed the music of Elvis, adored both her horses &ldquo;Scout&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dooley&rdquo;, and cherished spending time with her kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids. She was a competitive bowler for many years which later awarded her with an induction into the 2008 RC USBC Hall of Fame for superior performance. Her hands were an instrument of grace and that green thumb led her to work for several local greenhouses.<br />
<br />
Cheryle was funny and vivacious. She will forever be remembered for her tenacity, wit, feistiness, charm, and grace (when needed). She will also be remembered for her beautiful smile, gentle eyes, loving embrace, and unconditional love. She was appropriately self-nicknamed as &ldquo;Mom&rdquo; &ldquo;Mama&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; to countless individuals throughout her life. She listened to understand, would offer advice followed by the lesson, and would always leave you with one of her infamous hugs.<br />
<br />
Cheryle was one of the strongest women one could ever meet. She wasn&rsquo;t afraid of anyone or anything. She was a fierce Mama and put up a long fight with Alzheimer&rsquo;s, Lewy Body Dementia, and Vascular Dementia. Although our hearts are heavy, we will celebrate her life and find comfort that she is in heaven watching over us. She has left a permanent mark etched on our hearts and will be supremely missed.<br />
<br />
She is survived by her dearest &ldquo;John Boy&rdquo;, her husband, John E. Slagle &ldquo;Concrete John&rdquo; of Rapid City, SD, and three daughters: Tonja Slagle Read of Grand Island, NE, Kara Longland-Slagle (Jeremy Longland) of Rapid City, SD, Caryn Slagle-Scruggs (Tufani Scruggs) of Las Vegas, NV; 20 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. She also leaves many other family members and friends who will sadly miss her.<br />
<br />
She is preceded in death by her parents Duane C. and Eldora P. &ldquo;Granny&rdquo; (Dean) Smock of Rapid City, SD; son, Lee J. Cornog of Dothan, AL; daughter, Felicia Dale of Rapid City, SD; grandparents, several aunts, uncles, and friends.<br />
<br />
Her life was a living example of her favorite Bible prayer &mdash; God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference. Living one day at a time; enjoying one moment at a time; accepting hardships as the pathway to peace&hellip; This prayer was a great starting point for many life events Cheryle surpassed, it was always deep in her heart to ask the Lord for peace, for help to discern what to change, for focus, happiness, and how to obey His will.<br />
<br />
Church service will be held at Journey Church, 1981 Centre St., Rapid City, SD, on Friday, June 21, 2024, beginning at 2:00 pm.<br />
<br />
Journey Church will be live-streaming Cheryle&#39;s service for those unable to attend and the link will be provided before the service starts. We request that all guests wear purple in memory of Cheryle, as it was not only her favorite color, but a symbol that reflected her incredible fight with Alzheimer&#39;s and Dementia.<br />
<br />
A celebration of Cheryle&#39;s life will be held at The Eagles Lodge, 1410 E. Centre St., Rapid City, SD on Friday, June 21, 2024, beginning at 3:30 p.m.<br />
<br />
A private burial service will be held for the family at Black Hills National Cemetery, 20901 Pleasant Valley Dr., Sturgis, SD, at a later date.<br />
<br />
The family would like to thank all the healthcare professionals: doctors, nurses, volunteers, caretakers, and home health, for nurturing Cheryle through this journey. We are sincerely grateful to the wonderful medical staff with Home Health and Hospice who comforted and cared for her in her last days.<br />

Becky had a strong entrepreneurial spirit and was never deterred by hard work. She started and successfully ran two companies before ending her career in student financial aid.&nbsp;<br />
It was in Rapid City in May of 1983, that unbeknownst to Becky, she met the love of her life, David Chambers. Dave and Becky were married October 26, 1985, in Rapid City. They welcomed their first child in 1989, Katelyn, and then completed their family with Kelsie in 1991. Becky was an avid cheerleader for her children, never missing any activity her girls decided to partake in. She was a fierce advocate and protector of her children but believed that it was their own actions that resulted in their accomplishments. Becky unfailingly put her daughters and Dave before herself and went out of her way to make sure that they had everything they could ever want or need.&nbsp;<br />
Becky&rsquo;s world was irrevocably altered by the birth of her grandchildren. She shared such a special bond with her first granddaughter, Harper Sage. She was lovingly anointed as &ldquo;Gigi&rdquo; and was so proud of her grandbabies. The birth of her first grandson, Sterling Joseph, who she dubbed her &ldquo;miracle baby&rdquo; changed the course of her world. She was in awe of her grandson, Vance Daine&rsquo;s, compassion and loved his spirit. Becky always said how she was so thankful and blessed to have been given the time to meet her final grandchild, Everly Ames. She loved her children and her grandchildren beyond measure.&nbsp;<br />
Becky enjoyed traveling (within the continental United States&mdash;absolutely no flying over water), and spending time with the other loves of her life&mdash;her three family dogs (Lagger, Duff, and Yadi). Becky loved redecorating and renovating her home. She was overjoyed when she was able to completely remodel her kitchen in February of 2023. Becky&rsquo;s favorite place in the world was her backyard, where she and Dave spent many years creating a verdant oasis.&nbsp;<br />
Becky was preceded in death by her father, Vern Kellett, two sisters, Joyce Kellett &amp; Deborah McCarville, and her favorite aunt and uncle, Edith and Harry Riepl.&nbsp;<br />
Becky is survived by her husband, David Chambers, her mother, Neva (Richard) Kellett, her sister, Brenda (Chuck) Benge, her daughters Katie Cook and Kelsie (Morgan) Kronberg, her four grandchildren, and numerous nieces and nephews, all of whom she loved dearly.&nbsp;</p>

1637274,"Gregory &quot;Greg&quot;",R.,Blom,1959-02-26,2024-06-25,"<p dir=""""ltr"""">Gregory Ray Blom, known fondly as Greg to his friends and family, passed away peacefully on June 24, 2024, in Rapid City, SD. Born on February 26, 1959, in Pipestone, MN, Greg&rsquo;s life was a testament to the joy of simplicity, the warmth of friendship, the pursuit of adventure, and the beauty of nature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""""ltr"""">Greg treated everyone he met as if they were a neighbor on the farm down the street. He trusted people, and loved to help others in any way he could. He knew and loved God. He loved classic rock. He loved to fish, travel, and explore the mountains. He loved the Vikings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""""ltr"""">Greg was always looking for his next adventure, and yet the smallest things brought him so much joy. Whether it was a hike behind his house, a fishing hole, or a good conversation. He loved to travel, and enjoyed sharing stories from his travels around the world. If you were a friend at any point in his life, chances are Greg still talked about great memories with you 30 years later. One of his most precious items he kept was his address book filled with names and phone numbers of family and friends..many of which he still called through his last days. Social etiquette around time of day didn&rsquo;t apply to him. He just just called when he was thinking of you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""""ltr"""">A few noted life lessons Greg&#39;s daughter learned from her dad, and will forever hold onto: Roll the windows down. Fun doesn&#39;t always need a plan. Always get in the water. If you treat every experience like a core memory, there are very few experiences in life that aren&#39;t worth trying. Don&#39;t be afraid to be goofy, and always have a great story in your back pocket, you might see someone&#39;s face light up. Life is too short to hold onto many of the stresses and anxieties that weigh so many down. Love God.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""""ltr"""">Greg graduated from SW Minnesota Christian High School. He made a point to touch the hearts of everyone he met with his friendly demeanor and genuine interest in their well-being.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""""ltr"""">Greg is survived by his family. His daughter whom he named after his mother: Lucy Forgione (Erik). His legacy continues through his cherished granddaughter: Quinn Forgione. His sister whom he always looked up to: Karen (Walter) Loewen, and brothers whom he loved deeply and always shared stories about: Dennis Blom, Stephan Blom (Gala), and Phil Blom (Debbie). Lastly, the friendship and kindness of neighbors in the community that showed him God&#39;s love.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""""ltr"""">Greg&rsquo;s parents, who preceded him in death, were his heroes. He always spoke incredibly highly of them. Greg will be remembered for his spirit of kindness and adventure. This spirit will live on in the memories of his family and friends.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""""ltr"""">Greg&#39;s life will be celebrated in the hearts and stories of his family and friends, as they continue to honor his memory by embracing the values he lived by&mdash;kindness, friendliness, and a thirst for adventure. Rest in peace, dear Greg. Your spirit will forever wander the mountains you loved, and your legacy will continue to inspire us all.</p>

1637688,John,L.,Lambert,1942-04-25,2024-07-03,"<p>John L Lambert, Professor Emeritus of the University of Nebraska, succumbed to his injuries on July 3rd, 2024, following a bicycle accident doing what he passionately loved, riding his bike while experiencing God&rsquo;s gift of outdoor beauty. John&rsquo;s loss was unexpected, and his family is profoundly saddened.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
John was born on April 25, 1942, to Milburn and Mervein Lambert, in Thornburg Kansas. Moving to Nebraska as a small boy, he grew into a loyal fan of the UNL Football Team. At the early age of 12, John left home to work as a quarter horse trainer and jockey to raise money for college and assist the family financially. John attended the University of Nebraska receiving his BS in 1964 and MS in Animal Nutrition in 1966.&nbsp; During his years at the University of Nebraska, John became President of the Rodeo Club and won the title of All Around Cowboy at UNL in 1962 and 1964.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While at UNL, he met his future wife, Jeanne Frasier. They quickly fell in love and were married in July of 1963.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
John&rsquo;s occupations as a Livestock Specialist and Extension Educator following graduation from UNL aligned with his passion for animals, horses and education for the next 30 years. He achieved the status of Professor, Outstanding Agent in Nebraska, and the NACAA national achievement award as outstanding agent.&nbsp; During these years, John judged horse shows nationally, giving his time tirelessly to the people in his counties and never missing a beat between his educational duties as Co. Agent to flipping hamburgers at the 4-H diner during County Fair. After retiring from UNL, John and Jeanne moved to Colorado. For the next 20 years he worked for the USDA helping with computer roadblocks both at the USDA and privately helping those who needed his self-taught computer expertise.&nbsp; He became an avid bike rider throughout the foothills and mountains of Colorado, Europe and Nebraska. John left the house at 4:30 am to ride with the Poudre Sunrise Cyclists as well as the Windsor Pedalers. John and Jeanne traveled around the world and treasured the past 4 years in their beloved RV.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
John was a loving husband of 61 years to Jeanne. He was a caring and supportive father to three daughters, Kelli (Marc), Shawn (Paul), and Cami (Robert), eight grandchildren; Max and Ben; Ainsley, Corbin and Shelby; Laurel, Lainey, and Allie.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
His departure is gravely felt by his family and countless others who loved him deeply in his wide network of community. John&rsquo;s Celebration of Life will be held at the Buckhorn Llama Farm, 8857 Llama Ranch Rd, Loveland CO., Saturday July 27th, 2024, at 10 am. The family deeply appreciates your support during this difficult time and asks that in lieu of flowers, donations can be made in John&rsquo;s memory for a scholarship to the University of Nebraska awarded to a student who is pursuing their education in the field of Animal Science.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Celebration of Life will be held 10:00 AM Saturday, July 27, 2024 at Buckhorn Llama Ranch, 8857 Llama Ranch Road, Loveland, Colorado 80538.</p>

1637620,William,Herman,Krokel,1939-01-03,2024-07-04,"<p>William Herman Krokel was born in Java, South Dakota on January 3, 1939 to William<br />
and Emma Bertsch Krokel. His Father was killed in a farming accident and he was<br />
raised by his Father and step-father Adam Rieger. They moved to Aberdeen, South<br />
Dakota and William graduated from Aberdeen Central High School. He joined the<br />
military in 1957 and served in the Army. He was in Korea during his military service and<br />
part of the 1st Airborne Battle Group, 327th Infantry.</p>

<p><br />
After the service he moved to Seattle, but letters revealed that his heart was back in<br />
South Dakota and he settled in Rapid City, a place that he loved and where he<br />
remained his entire life. He was a survivor of the Rapid City Flood, where his home was<br />
destroyed by Rapid Creek which is now a large green space.</p>

<p><br />
William made his early living as an overland trucker, stopping unannounced to greet<br />
family in Aberdeen when his route took him close to home. Mom and Dad, his brother<br />
Richard and wife Carol with their three children were always ready to greet him as well<br />
as his little sister, Carol. He found time to fish with the family at the Missouri River,<br />
looking for the big Northern Pike or Muskie. Following his trucking career he worked at<br />
the Dakota Cement Plant until his retirement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
William loved his time in the Black Hills, always ready to show people the tourist sites,<br />
but when on his own, he loved quiet time at Angostura and had his own isolated fishing<br />
spots in the Hills. He was slim and fit his entire life, ready to hike anywhere to find that<br />
Rainbow Trout.</p>

<p><br />
He enjoyed his friends from work and the area. He described himself as a loner, and<br />
even as his body became less able he fought to live on his own, and make his own<br />
decisions until his last days when he was telling stories of past good times.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
He is survived by his sister, Carol Rieger, his sister-in-law, Carol Krokel, nephews Rich<br />
Krokel and Kerry Krokel, and his great-nephews Ricky Krokel and Nick Krokel and their<br />
families. He is preceded in death by his paternal father, William Krokel, step-father<br />
Adam Rieger and mother Emma Krokel Rieger, brother Richard Krokel, nephew Bradley<br />
Krokel, and brother-in-law Randall Holm. He is also preceded in death by step-sisters<br />
Delores Rieger Maynard and Darlene Rieger Nichols.</p>

<p><br />
William passed away on July 4, 2024 in Rapid City, South Dakota. May his eternal life<br />
be filled with the family that greets him and may the Black Hills of South Dakota forever<br />
be his home.</p>

<p>Graveside services with military honors will take place 3:00 PM Thursday, September 12, 2024 at Black Hills National Cemetery near Sturgis, SD.</p>

1638340,Kenneth,William,Novotny,1959-07-15,2024-07-13,"<p>Kenneth William Novotny, known affectionately as Ken to his friends and family, passed away on July 13, 2024, just two days shy of his 65th birthday. Born on July 15, 1959, in Winner, South Dakota, Ken carried the spirit of his small-town roots throughout his life, and his warm presence will be profoundly missed by all who knew him. Ken departed this world in Rapid City, SD leaving behind a legacy of love, wisdom, and thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>Ken spent his youth in Winner, SD where the rolling plains and the tight-knit community shaped a man who valued hard work, family, and the simple pleasures of life. After high school, he ventured into the world of logging and soon established himself as a self-employed logger, an occupation that allowed him to indulge his passion for the great outdoors. Ken&#39;s love for nature was evident to anyone who accompanied him to the Black Hills, a place he treasured and respected deeply.</p>

<p>An accomplished woodworker, Ken&#39;s hands were rarely still. His craftsmanship was not only a testament to his skill but also a tangible expression of his love for creating beauty from the raw elements of the earth. His works were more than mere objects; they were stories carved into wood, memories etched into the grains, and heirlooms that would stand the test of time.</p>

<p>Ken&#39;s greatest masterpiece, however, was his family. He is survived by his loving wife, Teresa Novotny, who stood by his side through the ebbs and flows of life. Together, they raised a family that reflected the values Ken held dear. His daughters, Joni (Kevin) Moore and Sadie Silva, and his son, Cory (Staci) Bintliff, will carry forward the lessons of kindness and integrity that their father instilled in them. He also treasured being a grandpa and in the love he showed for his 11 grandchildren and and four great grandchildren.&nbsp; Ken&#39;s brothers, Craig (Toni) Novotny, Dewey (Sharon) Novotny, and Dale Novotny, as well as his sisters, Janet and Debbie Novotny, will remember their brother as a guiding light, a source of unwavering support, and a man who always had time for a laugh or a word of advice.</p>

<p>Ken&#39;s life was a testament to the power of love and the strength of family bonds. He was a man who listened more than he spoke, and when he did speak, his words were laced with wisdom and sincerity. His thoughtful nature was a comfort to his friends and family, and his ability to find joy in the simple things was a lesson in gratitude for all who knew him.</p>

<p>As we bid farewell to Ken, we celebrate a life well-lived, a life filled with purpose, passion, and an abundance of love. While his sudden departure due to a heart attack has left a void that cannot be filled, the memories of his loving spirit will continue to inspire and guide us. Ken&#39;s legacy is not one of material possessions, but one of cherished moments, shared laughter, and the quiet strength of a loving father, husband, brother, and friend.</p>

<p>Ken&#39;s journey on earth has come to an end, but his story will be recounted around campfires, at family gatherings, and wherever the wind whispers through the pines of the Black Hills. His life was a beautiful journey, and though we mourn his passing, we take solace in knowing that Ken lived fully, loved deeply, and left this world a better place.</p>

<p>A traditional service to honor and celebrate Ken&#39;s life will be held at a later date, reflecting on the profound impact he had on those around him. As we gather to remember Ken, we will share the stories that paint a picture of a man who was truly one of a kind, and whose legacy will endure in the hearts of those he touched. Ken&#39;s life was a gift to us all, and for that, we are eternally grateful. Rest in peace, dear Ken. Your love and wisdom will forever be our guide.</p>

1639211,Michael,Terry,Waisanen,1987-07-03,2024-07-23,"<p>Michael Terry Waisanen, known to all as Mikey, has taken the ultimate half-pipe to the sky on July 23, 2024. Born on July 3, 1988, in the historic town of Deadwood, South Dakota, Mikey was a man who lived life with the kind of passion and creativity that could light up the darkest of garages. His final curtain call took place in Rapid City, South Dakota, surrounded by the love of his family and friends. Mikey was the beloved son of Ray Waisanen and Venus Vanarsdall, the brother who set the bar high for Daniel, Chyenne, Rayechael, and Clint, and the standard for cool for his brother Randal. He was the guy who, when he walked into a room, you knew the party had started, and when he left, you knew the after-party was where you wanted to be. A proud graduate of Lead High School, Mikey never lost his school spirit, and by spirit, we mean his uncanny ability to pull off a prank that would leave everyone laughing, including the janitor. His education extended far beyond the classroom, mastering the art of life with a wrench in one hand and a skateboard in the other. Mikey was a master craftsman, a title he earned every day with his work as an automotive mechanic. He wasn&#39;t just a mechanic, though; he was a magician under the hood, turning clunkers into purring beasts. He could listen to an engine and tell you its life story, dreams, and aspirations. Mikey&#39;s hands were always dirty, but his work was always clean.</p>

<p>Skateboarding was not just a hobby for Mikey; it was a philosophy. He approached every ramp and rail with the same focus and dedication that he did with every car that rolled into his shop. Snowboarding was his winter translation of that philosophy&mdash;gravity was a mere suggestion to Mikey, not a law. When he wasn&#39;t defying physics on wheels or boards, Mikey was a dungeon master extraordinaire. Dungeons and Dragons were more than a game to him; it was a stage where he brought legends to life, and where his creativity could run wild, like a gnome barbarian in a goblin market.</p>

<p>Family and friends were the core of Mikey&#39;s world. He was the heart and soul of every family gathering, not just because of his infectious laugh but because of his ability to make everyone feel loved and important. Mikey was the guy who remembered your dog&#39;s birthday and would help you move a couch without being asked. To describe Mikey as creative, passionate, and loving is an understatement. He was a man who loved fiercely, laughed loudly, and lived his life like it was a grand adventure. Every conversation with him was like the best improv show you&#39;ve ever seen&mdash;unpredictable, hilarious, and always from the heart.</p>

<p>Mikey leaves behind a legacy of laughter, a fleet of finely tuned automobiles, and a trail of epic skateboarding legends. His absence will be felt deeply, but the echoes of his laughter and the memories of his boundless energy will continue to inspire all who knew him. In the great gig in the sky, we know Mikey is probably arguing with the angels about the proper way to execute a kickflip or tuning celestial engines to run on stardust. He lived his life like a comic book hero&mdash;colorful, bold, and with a flair for the dramatic. And while his final issue may have come to a close, Mikey&#39;s story will forever be a bestseller in the hearts of those who loved him.</p>

<p>Rest easy, Mikey. You&#39;ve left the world a brighter, funnier, and much cooler place. We&#39;ll catch you on the flip side.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mary Ellen Miller, a beacon of love and laughter, passed away peacefully of natural causes on July 27, 2024, in Rapid City, South Dakota, at the venerable age of 77.</p>

<p>Born on May 17, 1947, in the heart of Clay County, West Virginia, Mary&#39;s life was a testament to the power of kindness and the joy of nurturing a family. Mary, a devoted homemaker, was the epitome of love in action. She dedicated her life to her family, creating a warm and welcoming home where everyone was greeted with a smile and an open heart.</p>

<p>She is survived by her children, Robert (Jenine) Rucker, Lisa Rucker, Mary (Francisco) Reyes, Walter (Christy) Lemasters, and Deryl Duane (Megan) Rider, a brother, Jerry Hamrick, a special mention of grandchildren whom she raised, Kayleigh and Alex Rider and a multitude of other grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who were her pride and joy. She raised them with a gentle hand and a generous spirit, instilling in them the values of compassion and humor that she lived by every day.</p>

<p>Mary was preceded in death by her parents, Dayton Cornelius and Mertie Gay (Brady) Hamerick, her husband, Robert Albert Miller, six sisters and one brother.</p>

<p>Her laughter was infectious, and her sense of humor brightened the lives of all who knew her. Mary&#39;s presence was a source of comfort and happiness, making her the heart of any gathering. She lived by the words of Mother Teresa, &quot;Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.&quot; Mary&#39;s life was a reflection of this philosophy, as she found beauty and purpose in the day-to-day acts of care and nurturing that make a family thrive. Mary&#39;s interests extended beyond the walls of her home. She had a passion for travel, exploring new places, and creating lasting memories with her loved ones. Her grandchildren were the recipients of her boundless love and were often spoiled with her affection and time. She found joy in the simple pleasures of life, such as listening to music and being surrounded by all types of animals. Her love for the natural world was a gentle reminder of the importance of kindness and empathy towards all living creatures. Mary&#39;s warmth and kindness were not confined to her immediate family. Her involvement in her community and associations was marked by the same generosity and commitment she showed at home. She was a friend to many, always ready to lend an ear or share a word of encouragement. Her legacy is one of love, laughter, and the countless lives she touched with her kind heart. As we bid farewell to Mary Ellen Miller, we are reminded of the impact one life can have on so many. She was not just a loving mother and grandmother, but a beacon of joy and a pillar of strength to all who had the privilege of knowing her. Her spirit will live on in the stories shared, the laughter remembered, and the love she gave so freely. Mary&#39;s life was a journey of love, laughter, and kindness. As we honor her memory, we take solace in knowing that her legacy will continue to inspire and uplift us. She has left an indelible mark on the hearts of her family and friends, and her warmth will be felt for generations to come. Rest in peace, dear Mary. Your love will forever be our guide.</p>

1639200,David,Dean,Sacry,1949-11-16,2024-07-29,"<p>David Dean Sacry, known affectionately to friends and family as Dave, lived a life that exemplified the triumph of a spirit filled with faith, wisdom, and love. Born on November 16, 1949, in the bustling city of Chicago, IL, Dave embarked on a journey that would see him touch countless lives with his kindness and ingenuity. His journey came to a peaceful close on July 29, 2024, in Rapid City, SD, where he passed away, leaving behind a legacy of warmth and inspiration. Dave was a beacon of guidance and support to his beloved wife, Kathleen Dianne Sacry, his son, Daniel Sacry, and his daughter, Cecelia, married to Andrew Bailey. His step-daughter, Saundra Armbruster, together with his four cherished grandchildren, also held a special place in his heart. Each family member was a testament to Dave&#39;s loving nature and his ability to foster strong, enduring bonds.</p>

<p>Dave was a proud graduate of Renton High School in Renton, WA. He furthered his knowledge by studying Electrical Technology at Renton Technical College, a decision that would shape his professional path. Dave&#39;s career was marked by honor and service, as he dedicated six years to the United States Air Force, from 1970 to 1976, attaining the rank of Staff Sergeant. His military service imbued him with a sense of discipline and camaraderie that he carried into his civilian life. After his service, Dave spent 40 years as an Electrical Technician for Physio-Control, a role in which he not only excelled but also brought innovation and reliability. His work ethic and expertise were not just assets to his profession but also to the many individuals who relied on his skills.</p>

<p>Dave&#39;s interests were as diverse as they were passionate. He found joy in the intricate details of radio-controlled cars, planes, and hydroplanes, marveling at the mechanics and the thrill of piloting them. He shared his love of driving with his wife, participating in TSD rallies and taking long, scenic road trips. His love for outdoor photography allowed him to capture the world&#39;s beauty through his lens, sharing his vision with all who appreciated the art. Model trains were more than a hobby; they were a canvas for his imagination, and his role as an avid collector and fixer of all things electrical was a testament to his insatiable curiosity and talent for problem-solving.</p>

<p>One of the words that best describes Dave is &quot;faith-filled.&quot; This trait was not only evident in his love for Jesus, but also in the trust and belief he had in the people around him. He was wise, dispensing advice that was both practical and profound, often leaving an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of those fortunate enough to receive it. Above all, Dave was loving. His capacity for love knew no bounds, and it was a love that was active, engaged, and unconditional. In the spirit of Dave&#39;s motivational outlook on life, let us remember the words of C.S. Lewis: &quot;Don&#39;t shine so that others can see you. Shine so that through you, others can see Him.&quot; Dave was that light that touched the lives of so many.</p>

<p>As we reflect on the life of David Dean Sacry, let us not mourn his passing but celebrate the remarkable journey he shared with us. Let his life be a reminder that each day is an opportunity to make a positive impact, to learn something new, and to cherish those we hold dear. Dave&#39;s story is one of a life well-lived, and his memory will continue to inspire and motivate all who knew him.</p>

<p>Memorial services will be held 10:30 AM September 9, 2024 at Tahoma National Cemetery, 18600 SE 240th Street, Kent, WA 98042.</p>

1639308,Debra,K.,Wanous,1958-05-19,2024-07-31,"<p>Debra K. Wanous, affectionately known as Debbie to her friends and loved ones, departed this world on July 31, 2024, after a lifetime of spreading joy and positivity. Born on May 19, 1958, in Rapid City, SD, Debbie&rsquo;s journey came full circle as she passed away peacefully in her hometown, surrounded by the familiar comforts of the Black Hills she so dearly loved. Debbie&#39;s life was one marked by a buoyant spirit and an unwavering kindness that touched the hearts of all who had the privilege of knowing her. She was the beloved wife of Rick Wanous, who stood by her as a testament to enduring love and partnership. Her brother, Jay and Janice Hrachovec, will remember her not just as a sister, but as a lifelong friend whose playful teasing was always a source of laughter and lightness in their lives.<br />
<br />
A proud graduate of Rapid City Central High School and the National College of Business, Debbie carved out a career that was characterized by her gentle demeanor and an optimistic outlook. She served with dedication as a bank teller at Black Hills Federal Credit Union and later brought smiles to visitors as she worked in the gift shop at Marine Life Aquarium in Rapid City. In every role, Debbie was more than just an employee; she was a beacon of positivity, uplifting her colleagues and customers alike. Debbie&rsquo;s zest for life was evident in her personal passions. An accomplished barrel racing competitor, she found freedom and exhilaration in the embrace of the sport she loved. Debbie was an avid reader, always keen to explore new worlds and ideas through the pages of a book. Her love for travel was boundless, with each cruise offering a new horizon to discover and the joy of creating lasting memories. Those who knew Debbie will remember her as the epitome of optimism. She embodied the words of Helen Keller, &quot;Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.&quot; Debbie lived by this creed, her life a testament to the belief that a kind word and a gentle touch can move mountains. Debbie&rsquo;s legacy is one of kindness and gentleness, a reminder that life&#39;s beauty often lies in its simplicity. She approached every day with a smile that could light up the darkest of rooms and a warmth that could thaw the coldest of hearts. Her spirit was a constant source of motivation, inspiring those around her to live with love and to cherish every moment. In celebrating Debbie&rsquo;s life, we are reminded that our time here is precious and that the impact we make on others is the true measure of our success. Debbie&#39;s memory will continue to be a guiding force, a gentle whisper encouraging us to live fully, to love deeply, and to embrace each day with an open heart and an optimistic soul we bid farewell to Debra K. Wanous, let us honor her memory by living the values she exemplified so beautifully. Her life was a journey of joy, her path marked by the laughter she shared and the happiness she brought to others. May we all strive to carry forward Debbie&#39;s radiant spirit, for in doing so, her light will continue to shine brightly in the world she has left behind.</p>

1641272,Joan,Theresia,Perdue,1938-06-08,2024-08-02,"<p>Joan (Bjorback) Perdue passed away peacefully at her home in Rapid City, South Dakota, on August 2, 2024. She was 86 years old.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Joan was born in Duluth, Minnesota, to John and Frances (Finn) Bjorback. She was the youngest of five children. She grew up primarily in Duluth and Minneapolis. Joan often joked that growing up in Duluth stunted her sense of navigational direction, because all she knew was uphill, downhill, left, and right.</p>

<p>A spirited, independent thinker, Joan knew she had met her life partner when her father introduced her to Don Perdue. They married in 1961 and started their family in Minneapolis. To support their family, Don worked as an independent carpenter while Joan sewed drapes. They advertised their services in the local nickel classifieds. They also acquired real estate by purchasing and remodeling forsaken duplexes.</p>

<p>Seeking a better life, they moved their young family out west, settling in Hamilton, Montana, in 1970. Soon after, Don had the &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; idea to build furniture. Together they started building bedroom furniture in their garage. Expanding the business, they moved to Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1986. At one time, their company consisted of three factories employing 300 employees. Joan expertly managed the books for their company, having taken only one educational course in bookkeeping. Once while helping a customer on the phone, the satisfied customer asked who he was speaking to. After giving her name, the customer said, &ldquo;Oh, the wife of the owner,&rdquo; to which Joan bristled, &ldquo;No, a Co-Owner.&rdquo; This was the pattern that repeated itself throughout their lives together. Don would formulate &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; entrepreneurial ideas while Joan was the nuts and bolts that helped bring them to fruition. Joan often joked that while Don shared his big plans, she would rollover in bed and tell him to go to sleep.</p>

<p>In 1968 Joan suffered a life-altering injury from a tobogganing accident. As a result, she was partially paralyzed from the waist down. While rehabilitating from her injuries in a nursing home, a fellow resident gave Joan an heirloom locket telling Joan that she had true grit. Once, while driving a carload of kids around, Joan parked in a handicap space. One little neighbor boy exclaimed, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t park here!&rdquo; He insisted that Joan was not handicapped, but just walked a little slow.</p>

<p>The accident did not dampen Joan&rsquo;s adventurous spirit. She traveled extensively with Don including trips to Russia, Italy, and China. In China, while struggling to eat with chopsticks, a table of locals clapped when she and Don finally got food to their mouths. Joan whispered to Don, &ldquo;If they think that is amazing, they should have seen me earlier peeing over a hole.&rdquo; Joan also traveled extensively with her daughter, Lori. While they were disappointed that their first big adventure to Helena, Montana, only took one tank of gas, they eventually spread their wings and traveled throughout the United States attending plays and other cultural events. In later years, Joan and Don enjoyed many blissful days on their boat in Anacortes, Washington. Joan loved sailing throughout the Pacific Northwest with her son, Richard, and her daughter-in-law, Tracy. They played many games of Sorry, always for money as was Joan&rsquo;s competitive nature.</p>

<p>Joan was interested in history from an early age. A story from her childhood that she often shared was that of her neighbor, Johnny Anunti. He was serving on the USS Indianapolis when it sank in the Philippine Sea. He told her of a shipmate who, after days of treading water told Johnny he was going to get his father&rsquo;s Cadillac; he swam away never to be seen again. Joan pursued her interest in history by taking a class at the University of Montana. As an unconventional student at the age of 50, she was nervous.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the semester, the professor wrote her a note stating that she had no need to be concerned about her abilities and that she belonged in a graduate level class.</p>

<p>Joan enjoyed daily pleasures. She loved going for car rides, stopping for a DQ Buster Bar along the way. She loved to sing, especially show tunes and somewhat inappropriate ditties. Joan was anticipating watching &ldquo;It&rsquo;s A Wonderful Life&rdquo; this December, an annual tradition much to the family&rsquo;s chagrin. She attended plays and lectures; she was a regular at the Journey Museum&rsquo;s Turtle Soup series. If you asked her, she was the museum&rsquo;s first attendee. Joan claimed that she could be a hermit, but this was the best-kept secret because her engaging, lively personality drew people to her. Recently while in a waiting room, a gentleman and Joan started exchanging quips. Dazzled by her wit, he commented that she could be a stand-up comedian. Joan responded, &ldquo;Well the funny thing is, I can&rsquo;t stand up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan was a warm and encouraging mom and grandma. She shared her love of World War II history with her grandson, Reed, who will be the beneficiary of her many history books. While babysitting her grandson, Riley, she would covertly eat the food on his plate that he disliked. As a special treat, she would take her granddaughter, Jaida, to the drive-up coffee shops for hot chocolate. She spent many hours on the phone with her grandson, Rhory, as he regaled her with his work stories.</p>

<p>Joan touched many lives. We will miss her sharp wit, her storytelling, her insights, and her unconditional love. Joan always joked that her plan was to die before undergoing any additional dental work; she had an appointment for two crowns scheduled for the Tuesday following her death. She would be smiling impishly.</p>

<p>Joan is survived by her children, Richard Perdue (Tracy) and Lori Stueber; grandchildren, Rhory Perdue, Jaida Fehrman (Brian), Reed Padilla (Brooke), and Riley Stueber; and sister, Nancy Anderson.</p>

<p>Joan is preceded in death by her husband, Don Perdue (2023); siblings, Catherine Sawdy, Jack Bjorback, and Richard Bjorback.</p>

<p><br />
A family gathering is planned to celebrate the lives of Joan and Don Perdue in Duluth, Minnesota, in October 2024.</p>

<p><br />
Flowers and gifts are not necessary. Instead, please keep the family in your thoughts.</p>

1641808,Sheri,LeeRay,Fernandez,1962-11-26,2024-08-17,"<p>Sheri LeeRay Fernandez, a woman whose laughter could light up the darkest room, took her final bow on August 17, 2024. Born on a sunny day in West Covina, CA, on November 26, 1962, she spent her life spreading joy and seasoning the world with her humor, much like a master chef &ndash; which, incidentally, she fancied herself to be in her own kitchen. Sheri&#39;s journey came to a peaceful end in Rapid City, SD, where she was surrounded by the love of her family and the comfort of memories filled with laughter and love.</p>

<p>Sheri&#39;s life was a recipe for happiness: two cups of wit, a dash of sarcasm, and an endless supply of love. She was the matriarch of a vibrant family that includes her children Latosha and Steven Huck, Miranda and Seth Oliver, and Dillon and Ashley Schad. Her grandchildren, Hannah, Hailey, Rihanna, Isaiah, Serenity, Peyton, and Michael, were the sugar in her cup of tea. Sheri&#39;s brothers, Carey and Melinda Grant, and Joe and Margaret Grant, always knew her as the funny bone of the family.</p>

<p>A proud high school graduate, Sheri turned the mundane into the extraordinary with her customer service prowess, first at Waste Management and then at the Hilton Hotel. She had the uncanny ability to make anyone on the phone smile, even while discussing their trash pickup schedule or booking a standard room with a view of the parking lot.</p>

<p>Sheri&#39;s interests were as flavor-packed as her famous Sunday roasts. She loved nothing more than cooking up a storm and sharing an occasional cocktail with friends. Her gatherings were legendary, not just for the food and drinks, but for the belly laughs and the warmth that came from her company. Sheri lived by the mantra, &quot;Life is uncertain. Eat dessert first,&quot; a pearl of wisdom by the great Ernestine Ulmer that she applied both literally and figuratively.</p>

<p>Words like spirited, funny, and loving are tossed around a lot, but Sheri embodied these traits with every fiber of her being. She was the life of every party, even if there wasn&#39;t a party until she arrived. She had a joke for every occasion and could find the humor in almost any situation. Her laughter was infectious, her spirit was indomitable, and her love was unconditional. Sheri was the kind of person who could make you feel like you were the most important person in the world, even if you were just the next in line at the grocery checkout.</p>

<p>Sheri&#39;s comedic timing was impeccable, and she would often quip, &quot;I&#39;m not arguing, I&#39;m just explaining why I&#39;m right,&quot; channeling the sass of a stand-up comedian. Her humor was a gift, a balm for the soul in trying times, and a reminder not to take life too seriously.</p>

<p>As we bid farewell to Sheri LeeRay Fernandez, let&#39;s not say goodbye; let&#39;s say, &quot;See you later,&quot; because someone as unforgettable as Sheri will surely be orchestrating a heavenly hoedown. Her laughter will echo in our hearts, her recipes will continue to nourish our bodies, and her legacy of love will forever enrich our lives. Sheri, you may have left the stage, but the encore of your memory will play on. Thank you for the giggles, the hugs, and the countless memories. Keep the cosmos chuckling, and save us a seat at the table for when we meet again.</p>

<p>Upon her request cremation has taken place and no services are planned at this time.</p>

1642599,Arthur,Lloyd,Anderson,1954-02-25,2024-08-26,"<p>Arthur Lloyd Anderson, known affectionately to friends and family as Artie, passed away peacefully of natural causes on August 26, 2024, in his hometown of Rapid City, South Dakota. Born on February 25, 1954, to the late Lloyd and Anna (Elizabeth) Anderson, Artie&#39;s warm presence and generous spirit were a blessing to all who knew him throughout his 70 years of life.<br />
<br />
Artie lived a full and vibrant life in the community where he was born and raised. He was a proud graduate of Rapid City Central High School and went on to build a robust career, first with Harvey Construction and then at the Rushmore Plaza Civic Center. His dedication to his work was matched only by his commitment to his family and friends.<br />
<br />
He is survived by a loving family including his brother, Monte (Jerry) Anderson; sister, Sherry (George) Freeman; brother, David &quot;Butch&quot; Anderson; niece, Shawntae (Jesse) Shaw; grand-niece, Maytaya Davis; grand-nephew, Justin Shaw; grand-niece, Aliegh Shaw; grand-niece, Haleigh Ray Shaw; grand-nephew, Mike Harvey; grand-nephew, Jr Harvey; cousins, William (Kim) Anderson, Colin Anderson, Tyler Anderson, Amy Anderson, Chravis Anderson, Bob Anderson, Jimmy (Jenelle) Anderson, Sandy (Rick) Sullivan, Peggy Anderson, Richard Anderson, and Monty Dooner. Artie was preceded in death by his parents and his brother, Larry Anderson.<br />
<br />
Artie was a man whose heart was as open as the South Dakota sky. His generosity knew no bounds, his kindness touched countless lives, and his selfless nature made him a pillar in his community. Whether he was working on a construction project or helping out at the Civic Center, Art always put others before himself. His legacy of love and service will continue to inspire those who were fortunate enough to have known him.<br />
<br />
An avid fisherman, Artie spent many days casting his line in the tranquil streams and lakes of the Black Hills, finding joy and peace in the great outdoors. His infectious smile and hearty laughter were a natural lure, bringing people together. Artie knew how to enjoy life, whether by sharing a good joke, throwing a lively party, or simply being in the company of friends and family. His favorite tunes, &quot;Oh Lord, It&#39;s Hard To Be Humble&quot; and &quot;Fishing in the Dark,&quot; were the perfect soundtrack to his fun-loving spirit.<br />
<br />
In the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, &quot;To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.&quot; Artie lived by this philosophy, and his success is evident in the lives he touched and the joy he spread.<br />
<br />
Arthur Lloyd Anderson will be dearly missed, but his memory will live on in the hearts of those he leaves behind. His was a life well-lived, full of laughter, generosity, and love, and he will be remembered as a true embodiment of the best of humanity. Rest in peace, dear Artie, and may your fishing lines be taut and your jokes forever bring smiles in the heavens as they did here on earth.</p>

1642979,Robert,Bernard,Sava,1945-11-03,2024-09-07,"<p>Robert Bernard Sava, a beloved husband, stepfather, and cherished friend, passed away peacefully of natural causes on September 7, 2024, in Rapid City, South Dakota. Born on November 3, 1945, in Yonkers, New York, Robert&#39;s journey through life was marked by love, intelligence, and a spirit of adventure that touched everyone he met.</p>

<p>Robert grew up in the vibrant city of Yonkers, where his early years were filled with the hustle and bustle of New York life. His family later moved to Modesto, California, where he graduated from Modesto High School, leaving a lasting impression on his teachers and peers with his sharp intellect and warm nature. He furthered his education at a State College in California, where he dedicated himself to the field of nursing, a profession that would define much of his life.</p>

<p>For over three decades, Robert served as a Registered Nurse, a role in which he exemplified compassion and professionalism. His dedication to healthcare was not merely a job but a calling, as he provided comfort and care to countless individuals with a gentle hand and a reassuring presence. He was a mentor to many in the nursing community, sharing his knowledge and experience with generosity and humility.</p>

<p>Robert&#39;s love for the great outdoors was unmistakable. An avid hunter, he often spoke of the tranquility he found in nature and the respect he held for the environment. His adventurous spirit led him on many excursions into the wilderness, each adventure adding stories to his rich tapestry of life experiences.</p>

<p>In addition to his outdoor pursuits, Robert was an enthusiastic member of the Civil War Reenactment community in Modesto, California. His passion for history was not only a hobby but also an extension of his love for storytelling and connecting with others who shared his interests. Through his involvement, he made lifelong friends and fostered a deeper understanding of the past.</p>

<p>Robert&#39;s life was a testament to the words of Helen Keller: &quot;Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.&quot; He embraced each day with a zest for life and an eagerness to experience all that the world had to offer. His loving nature was the cornerstone of his marriage to his devoted spouse, Cammy L. Sava, and his relationship with his step-son, Sean Andrews. Together, they created a home filled with laughter, learning, and love.</p>

<p>Those who knew Robert will remember him as a man of great intelligence, with a quick wit and a ready smile. He was a source of wisdom and comfort to his family, friends, and colleagues, always willing to lend a listening ear or a helping hand. His presence was a beacon of light, guiding those around him through times of joy and times of challenge.</p>

<p>As we bid farewell to Robert Bernard Sava, we hold onto the memories and the lessons he imparted. His legacy of kindness, curiosity, and courage will continue to inspire us all. Though he has left this earthly realm, the impact of his life will be felt for generations to come.</p>

<p>In honoring Robert&#39;s memory, we celebrate a life well-lived&mdash;a life filled with purpose, passion, and an unwavering commitment to the well-being of others. May we all strive to embody the spirit of adventure and love that Robert so effortlessly displayed throughout his remarkable journey.</p>

His industrious spirit also led him to a 23-year tenure at the Homestake Gold Mine and 15 years of commitment to H S Precision. His work ethic was only matched by his devotion to his family and friends. Raymond&#39;s life was enriched by the love of his family. He is survived by his daughters, Renae and her fiance (Jeremiah Simunek) Aubert, Carey and her husband Bart Fielder; his son, Ray Aubert, Jr.; and his adored grandchildren, Brinton Hamm, Mason Hamm, Kyle Aubert, Ashya Thomas and his favorite great-grandsons, Liam and Grayson Hamm. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Vivia Aubert, his parents, Marvin and Ida Aubert, his siblings, Constance, Betty, Jerry, Sharon, and DeLaine and his grandson, Brayden Aubert. Each member of his family held a special place in his heart, and he cherished every moment spent with them. Raymond&#39;s zest for life was apparent to all who encountered him. In his earlier years, he enjoyed the thrill of pheasant hunting, a pastime that spoke to his love for nature and adventure. His passion for dancing with his beautiful wife Vivia was known to many, as they often graced the dance floor with elegance and joy. Raymond&#39;s ability to make friends wherever he went was a testament to his friendly nature, and his sense of humor brought laughter to any gathering. Those who knew Raymond would describe him as loving, funny, and friendly. His presence was a source of comfort and happiness, and his absence will be deeply felt by all. As we remember Raymond, we are reminded of the words of Helen Keller: &quot;What we have once enjoyed we can never lose; all that we love deeply becomes a part of us.&quot; Raymond&#39;s legacy of love and laughter has indeed become a part of us, and his memory will forever be cherished. Raymond&#39;s life was a journey of joy, connection, and unwavering commitment to those he loved. As we bid him farewell, we celebrate the impact he made on our lives and the community he so dearly loved. He leaves behind a legacy of kindness, laughter, and an unbreakable family bond that will continue to inspire and guide us.<br />
<br />

1643024,Sandra,Maurice,Boyd,1934-09-17,2024-09-08,"<p>On September 8, 2024, she heard the gentle call of her beloved cowboy echoing from beyond, and with grace and peace in her heart, she left this earth to join him once more. Together, they now ride through eternity, side by side, just as they were always meant to be.</p>

<p>Sandra Maurice Bush was born to (Anthony) Wayne Bush &amp; Hazel Dell (Trout) Bush in Sioux Falls, SD on September 17, 1934.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sandy had a lifelong passion for horses, which began at a very young age. She rode Spitfire for several years before persuading her grandpa Trout to buy her a horse, Lady, when she was 15. Horses remained a cherished part of her life for the next 55 years. After the passing of Buck, they welcomed Donk, a donkey, into their family, and Sandy loved him dearly for the next 28 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sandy met the love of her life at the age of 15 while walking to the ice-skating rink. He drove past her, turned around, and offered her a ride. Her dream of a barn with a stairway up to the hay loft came true when Vaun took her home to Kimball to meet his family, and there was her stairway.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sandy worked at Bill&rsquo;s Market on North Cliff Avenue during her high school years. After graduating from Washington High School in 1953, she pursued a career as a secretary at First National Bank. She enjoyed her leisure time riding Lady and attending dances with her cousin, Mona, at the Arkota Ballroom until her cowboy returned from England.</p>

<p>Sandy and Vaun were married on March 18, 1955. On the night of their wedding, they celebrated at a west side tavern, but tragically, Sandy&rsquo;s father experienced heart failure and passed away. Following this, they spent the next four months in California.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upon returning to Sioux Falls, they were blessed with four children and resided in various homes. They were successful business owners with three grocery stores and three bars over the years. The family cherished their time together, enjoying trail rides, horse shows, and parades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1990, they fulfilled their dream of living in the Black Hills by selling everything and leaving Sioux Falls. They settled in the Custer area, where they owned Boyd&rsquo;s Antiques for 30 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those of us who will hold her deep in our hearts are her:&nbsp; four children, nine grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cindy Boyd (Ed Williams)-Stacy Baack. Tara (Doug) Hall-Liston, Amber. Chris (Jamie) Baack-Anna, CJ.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Willy (Kristie) Boyd-Lindsay (Dennis) Williams-Giana, Greyson.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dan (Luanne) Boyd-Danny Boyd. Travis Boyd-Aubrey. Kaitlin (Jeff) Sutton-Ozzy.</p>

<p>Dawn (Randy) Smart-Kassie (Walter) McDuff-Anthony, Alexis. Lee (Abigail) Smart-Maximus, Oliver, Leonidas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She was preceded in death by her loving husband of 68 years, Vaun, her parents, her brother and wife Wayne (Carolyn) Bush, her sister and husband Corrine (Lloyd) Breeden, her two nephews Tom Breeden and Obed Molstre, Vaun&rsquo;s parents, and his nine siblings and spouses.</p>

<p>Sandy and Vaun will be laid to rest in the Custer Cemetery. The family will hold two Celebrations of Life: on May 15, 2025, at the Custer VFW Post 3442 from 3:00 to 6:00 PM, and on May 17, 2025, in Sioux Falls, SD, at the Splitrock Volunteer Fire Department from 1:00 to 6:00 PM.&nbsp;</p>

1643863,Sierra,Gail,Borland,2010-03-01,2024-09-21,"<p>Sierra Gail Borland, known affectionately as Sierra to all who knew her, embraced life with a vibrant spirit that was as radiant as a star in the night sky. Born on March 1st, 2010, in Bakersfield, California, Sierra&#39;s journey was one marked by boundless enthusiasm and an innate ability to find joy in every moment. On September 21st, 2024, she concluded her chapter on this earth in Rapid City, South Dakota, leaving behind a legacy of love and creativity that will forever be etched in the hearts of those who had the pleasure of knowing her.</p>

<p>Sierra&#39;s family was the cornerstone of her world. She was a cherished daughter to Robert and Lisa Borland, and an inspiring sister to Andrew, his wife Alayna, Benjamin, and Daniel. Her relationships with each of them were built on a foundation of mutual admiration and deep affection. Sierra&#39;s thoughtful nature and intelligence shone brightly in her interactions with her family, strengthening their bond with each passing day.</p>

<p>In her academic pursuits, Sierra demonstrated an exceptional level of intelligence and curiosity. She completed the 8th grade at East Middle School in Rapid City, South Dakota, where her teachers and classmates recognized her for her creativity and her thoughtful contributions to every discussion. Sierra&#39;s quest for knowledge was just one of the many ways she expressed her zest for life.</p>

<p>Sierra&#39;s interests were a colorful tapestry of creative endeavors. She loved to paint, her canvas blossoming with the vivid hues of her imagination. Lego bricks became the building blocks of her dreams, each structure a testament to her innovation and determination. Crafting and baking were activities that not only allowed Sierra to express her creativity but also to share her love with those around her through the work of her hands. The joy of singing and dancing was another of Sierra&#39;s passions, filling her home with melodies and laughter. And when it came to board games, Sierra&#39;s competitive spirit was always in good fun, challenging everyone to strive for their best. In every aspect of her life, Sierra embodied the qualities of someone truly special. She was thoughtful, always considering the feelings and needs of others. Her intelligence was not merely academic, but also emotional, understanding the world around her with a wisdom beyond her years. Creativity flowed through Sierra like a river, touching everything she did with originality and flair.</p>

<p>As a motivational speaker might say, Sierra&#39;s life, though brief, was a powerful reminder that the quality of our time on this earth is not measured in years, but in the depth of our experiences and the love we share. In the words of the renowned poet Maya Angelou, &quot;My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.&quot; Sierra lived these words every day, her passion evident in her art, her compassion in her relationships, her humor in her play, and her style in her very essence. To have known Sierra was to have known a young soul who truly thrived, who took the ordinary and turned it into something extraordinary. Her life was a vivid reminder to all of us to live with intention, to embrace our creativity, and to love without reserve. Sierra Gail Borland&#39;s legacy is a tapestry woven with threads of joy, art, and the brilliance of a life lived fully, if not for a long time. Her memory will continue to inspire, to motivate, and to remind us that every day is a canvas waiting to be painted with the colors of our spirit. Sierra has not left us; she has simply moved on to paint in skies where every sunrise and sunset will reflect the beauty she shared with the world. A funeral service will be Friday, October 4, 2024 at 11:00 AM with a visitation one hour prior at The church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2250 Moon Meadows Drive, Rapid City, SD 57702.</p>

1644706,Linda,Diane,Cantrell,1963-10-13,2024-10-04,"<p>Linda Diane Cantrell, age 60, passed away peacefully due to natural causes on October 4, 2024, at Monument Health in Rapid City, SD, surrounded by her loving family. Born on October 13, 1963, in Wichita, KS, Linda&#39;s life was a testament to the power of love, dedication, and the simple joys that make a life well-lived.<br />
<br />
A devoted mother, cherished wife, and adoring grandmother, Linda leaves behind a legacy of warmth and kindness. She is survived by her husband, Kenneth Cantrell, with whom she shared countless moments of laughter and love. Her children, Jacob (Kelly) Graham and Jessica Fisher, will forever hold dear the lessons of compassion and resilience she instilled in them. Linda&#39;s grandchildren, Hailey, Haiden, Emma, Austin, Zander, Madelyn, and Desmond, were the light of her life, and she reveled in their every achievement and smile.<br />
<br />
For nine years, she served her community as a Certified Nursing Assistant, a role that reflected her selfless nature and her desire to help others. Her colleagues remember her as a pillar of strength and a source of unwavering support for both patients and peers.<br />
<br />
Her interests were as sweet and fulfilling as the baked goods she loved to create. Linda was an avid baker, a master of puzzles, and found her greatest happiness in the laughter and stories shared during the precious moments spent with her grandchildren. She was an enthusiast of the great outdoors, always ready to embrace the beauty and tranquility of nature.<br />
<br />
Linda was the embodiment of thoughtfulness. Her actions were guided by a loving heart, and she approached every person and every situation with a gentle spirit. Her selflessness was known to all who had the privilege of crossing her path, and her presence was a source of comfort and joy.<br />
<br />
As an individual who cherished the natural world and its wonders, Linda often found solace in the words of John Muir, &quot;In every walk with nature, one receives far more than he seeks.&quot; This quote was a guiding principle in her life, as she believed in the restorative power of nature and the simple pleasures it provided.<br />
<br />
We will remember Linda for her enduring love, her dedication to her family, and the countless lives she touched through her kindness. Her memory will be a beacon of love and selflessness that will continue to inspire those who knew her. Linda Diane Cantrell&#39;s life was a beautiful tapestry woven with the threads of love, kindness, and an unwavering commitment to others. Her spirit will forever remain in the hearts of those she loved and those who loved her.<br />
<br />
Upon her request cremation has taken place and services will be held at a later date.</p>

1644796,Donna,Lou,Gannon,1942-04-21,2024-10-08,"<p>Donna Lou Gannon, whose laughter was as infectious as her love for a well-stitched quilt, took<br />
her final bow on October 8, 2024, in Rapid City, SD after a grand adventure of 82 years.<br />
Born on April 21, 1942, in the bustling town of Williston, ND, Donna&rsquo;s story began as the<br />
beloved first daughter of Lloyd and Elsa Ferguson, who taught her to live with gusto and who<br />
both left this world before her.<br />
A graduate of Williston High School, Donna was the kind of student who could light up a<br />
classroom with her smile, maintaining many of those early friendships for life. Later, she lit up<br />
sales floors and offices with the same radiant energy. She sold dreams in the form of dresses at<br />
JC Penney&rsquo;s, coiffed hair to perfection at a local wig shop, preserved history at the Fort Union<br />
National Park Service and kept the gears running smoothly as the office manager for Petrolane<br />
in Fairview, MT. If you asked her, her most cherished role was that of a great wife to her<br />
husband, Frank &ldquo;Mick&rdquo; Gannon. Donna&rsquo;s life tapestry wasn&rsquo;t just made up of work threads, she<br />
wove in plenty of joy too. She could sew and quilt with great artistry and creativity, and was good<br />
at every craft she put her mind to. She never met a stranger and loved social outings with<br />
friends for good laughs and fun times. She was known to say, &ldquo;I like my jokes like I like my quilts<br />
- well patched and bound to leave you in stitches!&rdquo; Her love for the great outdoors was matched<br />
only by her enthusiasm for golf where she swung clubs with the same zest she approached<br />
everything in life. Donna&rsquo;s travel adventures could fill a book. When they were young, she took<br />
her kids on nature day hikes and camping trips, later in life, she and Mick enjoyed long road<br />
trips with their dogs and traveled all over the USA.<br />
Her sons, Brent (with his wife Dawnette), Jeffrey, and daughters Lisa Marie and Rebecca Ann<br />
(alongside her husband Bryce), were the pride of her life. Her step-daughter, Kristin Lynn<br />
Gannon, added to the rich tapestry of her family life. She is also survived by her 2 sisters, Bobbi<br />
(Pat) McMahon, Shelley Ferguson, 5 grandsons and 1 granddaughter; 4 great grandsons and 1<br />
great granddaughter, as well as 2 nephews, 1 niece and their children, all of whom she adored.<br />
Describing Donna is easy: friendly, loving, adventurous. She was the kind of person who could<br />
strike up a conversation in a room of strangers and leave with a roomful of friends. Her<br />
infectious laughter could turn a mundane gathering into a memorable soiree.<br />
Donna&rsquo;s life was a vivid palette of experiences. Her departure was as she lived - peacefully and<br />
on her own terms, surrounded by the natural beauty of the world she so dearly loved with her<br />
&ldquo;Mickey&rdquo; by her side.<br />
So, as we bid farewell to Donna Lou Gannnon, let&rsquo;s remember her not with a somber note but<br />
with a burst of joyous laughter echoing through the quilting aisles and across the golf courses<br />
she adored. She has taken the 19th hole to heaven.</p>

<p>Upon her request cremation has taken place and a celebration of Life will be held at a later date.<br />
In lieu of gifts and flowers, memorials may be made to Handoverrover.com or<br />
HannahPearlRescue.com to honor her love for animals and desire to help all animals be saved<br />
and live a better life.</p>

1645186,Shawna,Marie,Scott,1958-10-24,2024-10-15,"<p>Shawna Marie Scott, a cherished soul known for her kind heart, loving nature, and faith-filled spirit, passed away peacefully due to natural causes on October 15, 2024, in Rapid City, South Dakota. Born on October 24, 1958, in Powell, Wyoming, Shawna&#39;s early years were filled with the joys of small-town life, which shaped her into the remarkable woman she became.</p>

<p>Graduating from Powell High School in 1976, Shawna carried with her not only the education she received but also the enduring values of hard work and community. Her professional life was marked by a successful career as a highly skilled house painter, a trade where she excelled and brought color and warmth to many homes.</p>

<p>Shawna&#39;s marriage to her beloved husband, Robert Henry, was a testament to true partnership and love. Together, they built a life filled with mutual respect, laughter, and countless cherished moments. Her family was her pride, and her devotion to Robert was evident in every aspect of their shared life.</p>

<p>An avid sports fan, Shawna&#39;s weekends were often spent cheering on her favorite football and baseball teams. The thrill of the game and the camaraderie of fellow fans brought her immense joy. Yet, it was in the quiet moments, with a favorite novel in hand, that Shawna found solace and relaxation. Her love of literature allowed her to explore worlds beyond her own, fostering a rich inner life marked by curiosity and imagination.</p>

<p>Shawna&#39;s affinity for animals was undeniable. She shared her heart and her home with beloved dogs and cats, each of whom she adored. Her pets were not just companions; they were family, and her care for them reflected her boundless capacity for love.</p>

<p>Those who knew Shawna will remember her for the warmth she extended to everyone she met. She lived by the words famously said by Mother Teresa, &quot;Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.&quot; This philosophy was evident in every brushstroke on the canvas of her life, from the meticulous attention she gave to her painting projects to the gentle way she treated all living beings.</p>

<p>Shawna Marie Scott&#39;s legacy is one of enduring kindness, love, and faith. She navigated life&#39;s challenges with grace and emerged from each with an even stronger belief in the goodness of people and the power of hope. Her memory will be held in the hearts of all who were fortunate enough to know her, and her spirit will continue to inspire acts of love and kindness in their lives.</p>

<p>As we bid farewell to Shawna, we do so with the knowledge that her journey was one well-lived and that her impact will be felt for generations to come. We honor her life by carrying forward the love she so freely gave and by striving to live with the same compassion that she embodied.</p>

<p>Shawna is survived by her devoted husband, Robert Henry, and a community of friends and family who will miss her dearly. Her presence will be deeply missed, but the love she shared will forever be a beacon of light for those who were touched by her gentle soul.</p>

<p>In accordance with her wishes, Shawna&#39;s life will be celebrated in a private ceremony where stories will be shared, memories will be cherished, and her spirit will be honored. She will be laid to rest in a place that she loved, surrounded by the beauty of nature that she so admired.</p>

<p>As Shawna Marie Scott takes her leave from this world, we are reminded of the preciousness of life and the importance of cherishing every moment. Her journey on earth has ended, but her legacy of love continues to illuminate the path for all who knew her.</p>

<p>Upon her request cremation has taken place and no services are planned at this time.</p>

1645200,Ernest,Edgar,Landrum,1944-09-13,2024-10-15,"<p>Ernest Edgar Landrum, known for his sharp wit and curiosity as expansive as the universe he so loved to explore, fell asleep in death on October 15, 2024, at the age of 80. Born on September 13, 1944, in the humble town of Taft, California, Ernie&#39;s life was a testament to the power of humor, intelligence, and devotion. He passed away peacefully of natural causes in Rapid City, South Dakota, surrounded by his family in the Black Hills he had grown to love.</p>

<p>Ernest, or Ernie as he was affectionately called by those who knew his penchant for a good laugh, was a man of many talents and an intellect that could give Spock a run for his money. A graduate of Taft High School, he didn&#39;t just stop at academia; he embraced the role of a lifelong learner and teacher. As a devoted minister of Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, Ernie spent over 60 years imparting wisdom and spiritual guidance to his congregation, always ready with an anecdote or a light-hearted jest to make the message stick.</p>

<p>He shared a deep commitment with his spouse, Candy, a partnership that was both a personal and professional triumph as they co-owned and operated a janitorial business for 53 years. Their collaboration was a daily demonstration of their commitment to each other and the family they nurtured together. Their children, Jacob (Courtney) Landrum, Anna (Travis) Daniels, and Karen Landrum, along with grandsons Liam, Michael, Silas, Anthony, Gabriel, and Jonah, were deeply valued by him and each held a unique and important place in his heart.</p>

<p>A full-time evangelizer for 21 years, Ernie was known for his ability to turn even the most mundane biblical passage into something that his student could use in their life. His passion for teaching was matched only by his love for classical piano, science fiction, and astronomy. He truly couldn&#39;t wait for a future where he could learn all the secrets the universe had to offer.</p>

<p>Ernie&#39;s analytical mind was balanced by a passionate soul, and wry wit. He believed that laughter was the best medicine, and he prescribed it with his trademark irreverent touch.</p>

<p>He is preceded in death by his parents, Ernest and Aileen Landrum. While we mourn the loss of such a remarkable man, we also celebrate the incredible journey he shared with us. We look forward to the time we will see him again in the promised new world that he so fervently believed is just around the corner.</p>

<p>As we bid farewell to Ernie, we remember him not with somber hearts but with the joy and laughter he so freely gave. His was a life well-lived, full of passion and intelligence, and the stories he leaves behind will continue to inspire and entertain. As his wife Candy says &quot;He was a hoot!&quot;.</p>

<p>Ernie&#39;s legacy is a constellation of memories that will shine brightly in the night sky, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, a little bit of light&mdash; and laughter&mdash; can go a long way.</p>

<p>A memorial service will be held at 1:00 PM October 26, 2024 at Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses in Rapid City with Richard Daniels officiating.</p>

1645782,Timothy,James,Chamberlain,1954-02-04,2024-10-20,"<p>Timothy James Chamberlain, known affectionately as Tim to his friends and loved ones, passed away peacefully from natural causes on October 20, 2024, in Rapid City, South Dakota. Born on February 4, 1954, in Michigan, Tim&#39;s journey through life was marked by his infectious humor, profound wisdom, and boundless generosity. He was a beacon of joy and strength to all who knew him, and his legacy is one that will be cherished and celebrated.</p>

<p>Tim grew up in the rugged landscapes of Wyoming, graduating from Newcastle High School in Newcastle. It was there that he showcased his exceptional athletic talents, becoming a three-time Wyoming state Champion in the Butterfly and Individual Medley from 1970 to 1972. His passion for competition and excellence was evident early on and remained a defining characteristic throughout his life.</p>

<p>After high school, Tim worked for Exxon Oil where he was known for his reliability and unwavering work ethic.&nbsp;In later years, he ventured into the world of coal mining, working diligently in the mines of Wyoming for several years. Tim&#39;s colleagues remember him not only for his professionalism but also for his ability to lighten the mood with a well-timed joke or a piece of sage advice.</p>

<p>Beyond his professional pursuits, Tim was a man of diverse interests and hobbies. He held a deep appreciation for the natural beauty surrounding him, often exploring the Black Hills and neighboring areas on his two beloved Harley Davidson motorcycles. His adventurous spirit was matched by his love for collecting minerals, which he sought with the same determination and enthusiasm that he applied to all his endeavors.</p>

<p>Tim&#39;s family was the cornerstone of his life. He is survived by his devoted daughter, Kayla Mir, his loving son, Cody Chamberlain, and his caring sister, Teresa Ackley. Each of them carries forward the values Tim instilled in them, and his memory will continue to be a guiding light in their lives.</p>

<p>Those who knew Tim would describe him as funny, often sharing laughter with anyone in need of a smile. He was wise, dispensing insights that seemed to cut to the heart of any matter. And above all, he was generous, always willing to lend a hand or offer support without expecting anything in return. Tim&#39;s presence was a gift, and his absence will be deeply felt.</p>

<p>In the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, &quot;To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children... to leave the world a bit better... to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.&quot; Tim embodied this sentiment, living a life that touched many and left a lasting imprint on the world.</p>

<p>As we bid farewell to Timothy James Chamberlain, we celebrate the remarkable man he was, and we take comfort in knowing that his spirit lives on through the countless lives he enriched with his humor, wisdom, and generosity. Tim&#39;s story is one of a life well-lived, and though he may have departed from this world, the memories and lessons he leaves behind will continue to inspire and uplift us all.</p>

<p>Upon his request cremation has taken place and no services are planned at this time.</p>

1647322,Zachery,Wayne,Morgan,1993-05-20,2024-11-19,"<p>Zachary Wayne Morgan, known for his infectious laugh and the uncanny ability to fix just about anything except a broken heart, left us to embark on his final adventure on November 19, 2024. Born on May 20, 1993, in the bustling town of Joplin, Missouri, Zachary - or Zach as he was affectionately called - was the type of guy who could bring a smile to your face even on the dreariest of days.</p><p>Zach's journey led him from the humble beginnings of Joplin to the rugged beauty of the Black Hills of South Dakota, where he took his last breath. He leaves behind a family who adored him: his mother, Miranda Wilson, who taught him the art of a perfectly timed joke, his sister and brothers, Lacy Wilson, Jeremiah and John Wilson and his Hunka Mom Chris Zahn who was often the willing audience to his comedic escapades. Zach was a man of simple pleasures and grand adventures. He graduated with a GED, proving that traditional paths weren't always the most educational. He found his calling in commercial construction, where he could build and create, often leaving his coworkers in stitches with his on-site antics.</p><p>His interests were as unique as his personality. Zach could be found jamming to his favorite tunes - the louder, the better - or laughing uproariously at cartoons that reminded everyone that growing up is truly optional. The Black Hills of South Dakota were his sanctuary, where he'd recharge his spirit amid the whispering pines and granite peaks.</p><p>Describing Zach could fill a book, but if one had to choose just a few words, they would be adventurous, thoughtful, and handy. He was the Indiana Jones of home repairs, a philosopher in a tool belt, and the friend you called when you needed a laugh or a hand. Zach lived life like a comedy sketch, always looking for the punchline. In his honor, let's remember a quote from the legendary Robin Williams, a man Zach admired for his quick wit and warm heart: """"You're only given a little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it."""" Zach certainly never lost his spark, and his madness was the kind that drew people in, making the world a brighter place. We won't say Zach left us too soon, because a character like him is timeless. He's probably somewhere out there, in the great beyond, chuckling at the fact that we're all down here, taking life a little too seriously. So, in the spirit of Zach, let's crack a smile, share a joke, and remember that life is best lived with a hearty dose of laughter.</p><p>As we bid farewell to Zachary Wayne Morgan, let's not dwell on the silence he leaves behind but instead fill it with the echoes of our laughter and the warmth of the memories he gave us. He's taken his final curtain call, and what a performance it was. Encore, Zack, encore.</p>",,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/CFSV2/obituaries/photos/12123/1647322/673fc12c25d17.jpg

1649803,Mitchell,Ward,Conklin,1985-09-20,2024-12-27,"<p>Mitchell Ward Conklin, known for lighting up the room with his quick wit and infectious laughter, embarked on his final journey on December 29, 2024. Born on September 20, 1985, in Idaho, Oregon, Mitchell&#39;s zest for life never waned throughout his 39 years. As a man who always saw the glass as half full&mdash;preferably with something caffeinated&mdash;Mitchell left us as he lived, embracing the natural cycle of life in Rapid City, South Dakota.</p>

<p>Mitchell was the beloved ringmaster of his personal circus, featuring his adoring children, Melody and Max Conklin, and his devoted partner, Alicia Thompson, who were his greatest fans and the heart of his comedic universe. His mother, Rene&#39; Lindsay, survives him, forever proud of the man he became. While his father, Roger Conklin, preceded him in death, their shared sense of humor lives on as a family legacy.&nbsp;After finishing high school, where he was voted &quot;Most Likely to End Up on a Comedy Tour,&quot; Mitchell dabbled in higher education, collecting knowledge and laughs in equal measure. He eventually found his stage behind the cash register at the Flying J Truck Stop in Rapid City, where he didn&#39;t just punch in numbers but also punched in punchlines, brightening the days of travelers and truckers alike.</p>

<p>A man of simple pleasures, Mitchell was the king of his couch when it came to indulging in comedy shows, chuckling along with the likes of Jerry Seinfeld and Kevin Hart. His love for Rock and Roll was no secret&mdash;bands like Five Finger Death Punch fueled his air guitar performances, much to the amusement (and occasional embarrassment) of his children.</p>

<p>The Black Hills of South Dakota were his backyard, where he&#39;d often retreat for a dose of nature and a break from his adoring public.</p>

<p>He enjoyed listening to Joe Rogan and Bert Krieser podcasts, they were a staple in his daily routine, providing a soundtrack of stories and laughs that he&#39;d eagerly share with anyone within earshot. It was this blend of humor and intelligence that made Mitchell not just funny, but genuinely insightful. His ability to find the punchline in the mundanity of life made every moment with him an episode worth tuning in for. Mitchell was a man who could find the funny in the ordinary, and in his honor, we remember the words of the great Robin Williams: &quot;You&#39;re only given a little spark of madness. You mustn&#39;t lose it.&quot; Mitchell not only kept his spark but turned it into a roaring fire of joy and laughter, warming the hearts of those around him.</p>

<p>To know Mitchell was to love him, and to hear him laugh was to feel the world lighten a little. He was a loving father, an endearing partner, and a friend who could always be counted on for a joke or a kind word. His intelligence shone through his humor, making his wit as sharp as it was delightful.</p>

<p>As we bid farewell to Mitchell Ward Conklin, we remember a man who lived as we all should&mdash;with laughter, love, and a touch of rock &#39;n&#39; roll. He danced through life on a stage of his own making, and though the final curtain has fallen, the encore of his memory will play on in the hearts of all who knew him. Rest in peace, Mitchell, and may your jokes continue to echo in the laughter of your loved ones.</p>

<p>Upon his request, cremation has taken place and no services are planned at this time.&nbsp;</p>

This philosophy was evident in the way Michael lived his life, always ready with a joke, a smile, and a helping hand.&nbsp;His interests went beyond his love for music and mechanics. Michael cherished spending quality time with his family, whether it was a spontaneous road trip with his rock and roll tunes playing in the background or a quiet evening at home surrounded by the laughter and stories of his loved ones. He taught his children the importance of living fully and loving deeply, always encouraging them to pursue their passions with the same vigor he did his own.</p>

<p>Through his life, Michael touched the hearts of many. He was the kind of person who left a lasting impression, not through grand gestures, but through the genuine kindness and wisdom he offered in everyday interactions. His presence was a comfort, and his words often provided guidance to those he encountered.&nbsp;As we bid farewell to Michael Leon Austin, we reflect on a life well-lived, a journey marked by the love he gave and the love he received. He was a simple man, but his impact on the world was anything but. Michael&#39;s story is not one of sorrow, but a celebration of a life that, in its simplicity, was profoundly beautiful. We will carry his memory with us, finding comfort in the melodies of his favorite rock and roll songs, the purr of a well-tuned engine, and the laughter that he so easily evoked. In honoring Michael&#39;s life, we acknowledge the beauty of a life that, while ordinary in its pursuits, was extraordinary in its effect. Michael&#39;s life reminds us all to cherish the simple moments, to find joy in the everyday, and to live with a heart full of love and hands willing to work. His passing is not an end, but a continuation of his spirit through the lives of those he loved and who loved him in return. Michael Leon Austin, a man of laughter and love, will be dearly missed, but his legacy will forever be a part of us.</p>

<p>Upon his request, cremation has taken place and services will be held at a later date.</p>

1650336,Mavis,Monell,Cochran,1949-10-13,2025-01-08,"<p>Mavis Monell Cochran, a beacon of gentle kindness and unwavering love, passed away peacefully from natural causes on January 8, 2025, in Rapid City, South Dakota. Born on October 13, 1949, in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, Mavis&#39;s life journey was marked by selfless dedication to her family, friends, and faith.</p>

<p>Mavis spent her formative years in Jay, Oklahoma, where she completed the 11th grade at Jay High School. Her education laid the foundation for a lifetime of learning and growth, characteristics that would come to define her. Mavis&#39;s hands were rarely still, as she channeled her talents into becoming an accomplished seamstress. Her work not only clothed her loved ones but also wove a tapestry of memories that her family will cherish forever.</p>

<p>Her heart was her guide, and it led her to a life of service and devotion. Mavis&#39;s unwavering faith was evident to all who knew her, as she read her Bible daily, living the words she cherished. In the words of Mother Teresa, &ldquo;Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.&rdquo;&nbsp;Mavis embodied this sentiment, touching lives with her small acts of great love.</p>

<p>Mavis&#39;s love for her family was the cornerstone of her existence. She is survived by a family that adored her: sons, Quinton Cochran and John Cochran, III; siblings, John B. (Glannis) Wooten, Sherrel (Kay) Wooten, Kevin (Belle) Wooten, Janice (Mitchell) Sisk, Marilyn (Mike) Goforth, Jonnetta (Kip) Marquis, Roger (Jennifer) Wooten, and Karen (Russ) Roper. Each family member was a precious thread in the fabric of her life, and her legacy will live on through their stories and shared memories. Loved ones that have preceded her in death are her husband, Johnny C. Cochran; siblings Harl and Calvin Wooten and Melva Scraper.</p>

<p>Beyond her family and faith, Mavis had a profound appreciation for the beauty of the natural world. She cherished her time spent sightseeing in the Black Hills of South Dakota, where the majesty of the landscape echoed the beauty of her soul. Her love for exploration and adventure brought joy to those who accompanied her on these treasured excursions.</p>

<p>Mavis&#39;s character was marked by her loving nature, selflessness, and a gentle spirit that soothed and uplifted all who were fortunate enough to cross her path. Her life was a living example of kindness and compassion, and her memory will be a guiding light for those she has left behind.</p>

<p>A life so beautifully lived deserves to be beautifully remembered. Mavis Monell Cochran was a testament to the enduring power of love, and she will be deeply missed by all who were touched by her grace. As her family and friends bid her farewell, they take comfort in knowing that her spirit will continue to inspire and guide them, just as the stars guide travelers in the night sky.</p>

<p>Mavis&#39;s journey on earth may have come to a gentle close, but her story is far from over. It is etched in the lives of those she loved and will be told for generations to come. As the sun sets on her time with us, we look to the horizon, knowing that her light will shine on in the memories we hold dear.</p>

<p>Upon her request, cremation has taken place and a celebration of life will be planned for the spring of 2025.</p>

1650664,Dallas,Robert,Latham,1950-08-11,2025-01-11,"<p>Dallas Robert Latham, a cherished soul known for his gentle demeanor, selfless nature, and loving heart, passed away peacefully due to natural causes on January 11, 2025, in Rapid City, South Dakota. Born on August 11, 1950, in Kewanee, Illinois, Dallas spent his life touching the hearts of those around him and leaving an indelible mark of kindness on his community. Dallas completed his high school education and shortly thereafter embarked on a career that would see him operating a printing press with precision and care. His work ethic and dedication were evident to all who knew him. In the latter part of his career, Dallas found joy in the freedom of the open road as an over-the-road truck driver, a job that allowed him to explore and connect with people from all walks of life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Dallas was a man of simple pleasures and profound talents. His love for woodworking was matched only by the joy he found in the smiles of friends and family as they admired his handcrafted creations. A man of routine, Dallas indulged in the simple delight of starting his mornings with his favorite TV programs, accompanied by his unconventional yet favorite breakfast of ice cream and cake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;He lived by the adage, &quot;A stranger is just a friend waiting to be made,&quot; a sentiment that guided his effortless ability to forge lasting friendships. Dallas never knew a stranger, and his capacity to develop friendships with ease was a testament to his warm and inviting personality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Dallas is survived by his extended family, including Christopher and Michelle Verbeck, along with their kin, and a community of friends who were as dear to him as family. His absence will be deeply felt, and the memories he created with each one will be treasured forever.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In describing Dallas, one would be remiss not to mention the profound impact of his selflessness. He was always the first to lend a helping hand, a listening ear, or words of encouragement. His actions exemplified the famous words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, &quot;To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.&quot; Dallas succeeded in every sense, leaving behind a legacy of love, generosity, and genuine human connection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;As we bid farewell to Dallas Robert Latham, we reflect on a life well-lived, a journey marked by the joy of giving, and the quiet satisfaction of knowing that the world was a better place for his presence. His gentle soul will continue to inspire those who were fortunate enough to have known him, and his life lessons will endure through the stories shared by those who loved him.</p>

<p>Dallas&#39;s journey through life was a testament to the beauty of an ordinary life lived extraordinarily well. He exemplified the virtues of kindness, compassion, and humility, teaching us all that the richest lives are often those filled with simple pleasures, love for one&#39;s craft, and the company of good friends and family.</p>

<p>&nbsp;As we honor the memory of Dallas Robert Latham, we take solace in knowing that his spirit will live on in the hearts of those he touched. Though he has departed from this earthly realm, the echoes of his laughter, the warmth of his embrace, and the wisdom of his words will remain with us always.</p>

<p>Rest in peace, Dallas. Your journey was one of purpose, your life a beacon of hope, and your legacy a blueprint for a life well-lived. You will be missed but never forgotten.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Upon his request, cremation has taken place and no local services will be held at this time.</p>

1650726,Larry,John,Johnson,1945-11-16,2025-01-14,"<p>Larry John Johnson, a cherished husband, father, grandfather, and friend, passed away on January 14, 2025, at the age of 79 in Rapid City, South Dakota, due to natural causes. Born on November 16, 1945, in St. Paul, Minnesota, Larry&#39;s life was a testament to the power of love, kindness, and a spirited zest for life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Larry&#39;s journey began in the heart of Minnesota, where he grew up surrounded by the love of his parents, Harold and Mollie Johnson, who predeceased him along with a son, Travis Thomas. He attended Mechanic Arts High School in St. Paul, where he laid the foundations of a robust work ethic that would follow him throughout his life. After graduation, Larry embarked on a career that spanned 45 years as a store manager in the HVAC and refrigeration industry, where he was known for his dedication and leadership.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later, Larry found a new passion in real estate, working as a Real Estate Agent for Coldwell Bankers in Rapid City, South Dakota. His warm personality and genuine care for others made him a favorite among clients and colleagues alike. Larry&#39;s professional life was marked by a commitment to excellence and service, qualities that endeared him to many.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Outside of work, Larry loved to shoot hoops and play badminton with his grandchildren. He mostly enjoyed their hugs when they were leaving. He was an avid motorcycle enthusiast. He found joy and freedom on the open road, a pleasure he often shared with friends and family. His love for golf provided him with countless hours of enjoyment and friendly competition. A loyal fan of the Denver Broncos, Larry never missed a game and took great delight in cheering on his favorite football team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Larry was a man who cherished simple pleasures, including savoring his favorite scotch, a reflection of his ability to find happiness in the everyday. He lived by the words of Helen Keller: &quot;The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched&mdash;they must be felt with the heart.&quot; This quote encapsulated Larry&#39;s approach to life, as he always prioritized the emotional bonds and experiences that brought depth and richness to his existence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Remembered as loving and kind, Larry&#39;s spirit touched the lives of all who knew him. His presence was a source of comfort and joy, and his ability to connect with people on a genuine level was one of his most remarkable traits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Larry&#39;s legacy lives on through his beloved family. His grandchildren called him Hip-pa for Hippy Pa because Donnie his son endearingly called his dad Larry Hippy. He is survived by his devoted spouse, Tonia Le Febre-Johnson; his loving daughter, Brandy Guinard; his sons, Daniel (Amy) Le Febre and Donnie (Kylie Kindred) Le Febre; and his cherished grandchildren, Dusty and Wyatt Le Febre and Peyton Wilson. Each of them carries a piece of Larry&#39;s heart and spirit, and they will continue to honor his memory through the way they live their lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we bid farewell to Larry John Johnson, we reflect on a life well-lived&mdash;a life full of passion, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to the ones he loved. He left this world better than he found it, and for that, he will be deeply missed and forever remembered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Celebration of Life service to celebrate Larry&#39;s life will be held by his family at a later date. They invite all who knew and loved him to take a moment to reflect on the joy and laughter he brought into their lives and to cherish the memories that will keep his spirit alive in their hearts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the words of Helen Keller, which Larry held dear, we are reminded that the essence of a person&#39;s life is not in the material possessions or accolades they acquire but in the intangible, heartfelt experiences they share with others. Larry&#39;s life was indeed a beautiful tapestry woven with love, joy, and the richness of genuine human connection.</p>

Born on May 17, 1954, in La Porte, Indiana, Carol&#39;s life was marked by her friendly spirit, thoughtful nature, and creative soul.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Carol&#39;s journey was one of dedication and service. After obtaining her GED, she joined the United States Air Force in 1973, where she committed twenty years to serving her country, retiring as a Tech Sergeant. Her post-military career saw her working for United Airlines in their call center, where her warm demeanor and helpful attitude were greatly appreciated by all who interacted with her.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Her interests were as colorful and diverse as her personality. Carol was an artistic soul who loved to draw and expressed her creativity through crochet and tatting. She found joy in the fictional worlds of Star Trek movies and the rugged scenes of westerns and spent countless hours connecting with friends and family on Facebook, sharing her life and passions with the world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Carol was the embodiment of kindness and generosity, always ready to lend an ear or a helping hand. She is fondly remembered by her three sisters, Linda Essmaker, Toni Toney, and Sharla Sanders; her brother, Ken Barney; and her numerous nieces and nephews who reveled in her imaginative tales and creative gifts. Carol&#39;s memory will be treasured by all who knew her, and her legacy will live on in the stories shared and the lives she touched.</p>

<p>She now joins her parents, Kenneth Barney and Margery Sanders, and her brothers, John Sanders and Bill Barney, who preceded her in death. The absence of her vibrant presence will be deeply felt by her family and friends.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In the words of the great William Shakespeare, &quot;All the world&#39;s a stage, and all the men and women merely players; they have their exits and their entrances.&quot; Carol played her role on this earth with grace and left behind a script of memories that will be recited with love and admiration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Carol Sue Barney&#39;s life was a tapestry of service, creativity, and connection. As we celebrate her life and mourn her passing, we hold close the laughter, the stories, and the indelible mark she made on this world. Her spirit, a beacon of friendliness and thoughtfulness, will continue to inspire those who knew her to live with compassion and to cherish the beauty in life&#39;s simple pleasures.</p>

<p>Upon her request cremation has taken place and services will be held in West Valley City, Utah at a later date.</p>

1653955,Young,Sik,Kim,1963-06-12,2025-02-15,"<p>Young Sik Kim, a cherished husband, father, brother, and friend, left this world peacefully due to natural causes on February 15, 2025, at the age of 61, in Rapid City, South Dakota. Born on June 12, 1963, in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, Young&#39;s early years were filled with the rich culture and traditions of his homeland.<br />
<br />
Young&#39;s educational journey began in his hometown, where he graduated from Pochun High School. He carried his passion for learning to Seoul University, graduating with honors and setting the stage for a future filled with ambition and accomplishment. Young&#39;s professional life was marked by his entrepreneurial spirit, as he founded and ran JK Home Remodeling, LLC, dedicating 18 years to building and restoring homes, creating a legacy of shelter and comfort for many families.<br />
<br />
He was a man of many interests, finding joy and solace in the beauty of nature. Hiking, biking, camping, fishing, and swimming in the mountains were among his favorite activities, pursuits that reflected his deep appreciation for the great outdoors. Young&#39;s love for music, particularly his enthusiasm for Elvis Presley, was well-known, and his spirited karaoke performances were a source of joy for all who had the pleasure of witnessing them.<br />
<br />
Above all, Young was a family man. He is survived by his loving spouse, Yun Sun Hong, and their four children: Joseph, Joshua, Jennifer, and Jana Kim. His four brothers and a sister will remember him fondly, as will the countless lives he touched with his wisdom, creativity, and loving nature.<br />
<br />
Those who knew Young would describe him as a wise man, whose advice was always sought and cherished. His creative spirit shone through in everything he did, from his professional work to his personal hobbies. But perhaps the attribute that will be most remembered is his loving nature, a quality that made him a beacon of warmth and affection in the lives of his family and friends.<br />
<br />
As we reflect on Young&#39;s life, we are reminded of a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson: &quot;To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.&quot; Young Sik Kim embodied this sentiment, leaving behind a legacy of eased burdens and shared joy.<br />
<br />
Young&#39;s life was one of purpose and passion, of dedication to his loved ones, and of a deep commitment to leaving the world better than he found it. We take comfort in knowing that his legacy will live on in the hearts and memories of those who were fortunate enough to know him.</p>

1653320,Jay,David,Morse,1943-12-08,2025-02-18,"<p>Jay David Morse, a cherished husband, father, grandfather, and brother, passed away peacefully of natural causes on February 18, 2025, in Box Elder, South Dakota. Born on December 8, 1943, in Waukesha, Wisconsin, Jay&#39;s life was marked by his dedication to his family, his passion for the open road, and his unwavering optimism.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Jay grew up in the heart of Wisconsin, where his early years were shaped by the love and guidance of his parents, Wilbur and Grace Morse, both of whom preceded him in death. He attended Arrowhead High School in Hartland, Wisconsin, and later in life honed his skills at Western Dakota Technical Institute, earning an automotive degree that paved the way for his future endeavors.</p>

<p>He faithfully served his country during the Vietnam Era from June 27, 1966 until June 28, 1972. He was honorable discharged as a E-5.</p>

<p>&nbsp;His career as an over-the-road truck driver was not just a job but a calling. Jay took to the highways with a sense of adventure and purpose, and he found joy in training many aspiring truck drivers, sharing his vast knowledge and experience with the next generation. His work ethic was unparalleled, and his contributions to the field were widely respected among his peers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Jay&#39;s life was rich with interests that spoke to his character. He was an avid fan of John Wayne western movies and could often be found engrossed in a Louis L&#39;Amour novel, relishing the tales of courage and frontier justice. His love for westerns was only matched by the joy he found in teasing his great-grandchildren, a pastime that brought laughter and happiness to family gatherings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Those who knew Jay would describe him as a handy man with a loving heart and an optimistic spirit. He could fix almost anything, and his hands were rarely still. His optimism was a beacon for his family, lighting the way through life&#39;s challenges with a gentle reminder that, as Helen Keller once said, &quot;Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Jay&#39;s legacy is carried on by his devoted wife, Margaret Morse, and their children: David Morse, Ervin (Lori) Morse, Tommy Morse, and Linda Jean Morse. He was a proud grandfather to five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, who will miss his playful spirit and wise counsel. He is also survived by his loving sisters, Joyce and Jill, who will remember their brother with fondness and deep affection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In addition to his parents, Jay was preceded in death by four brothers and three sisters, with whom he shared an unbreakable bond and countless cherished memories.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Jay David Morse lived a life full of love, hard work, and cherished moments. He left this world better than he found it, through his kindness, his teachings, and his enduring belief in the goodness of people. As his family and friends bid farewell to this remarkable man, they take comfort in knowing that his journey was a full one, and his story&mdash;a tale of love, labor, and laughter&mdash;will be told for generations to come.</p>

<p>&nbsp;As we say goodbye to Jay, we celebrate a life well-lived and a journey well-traveled. His memory will live on in the hearts of those who loved him, and his influence will continue to guide us on the road ahead.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Upon his request cremation has taken place and no services are planned at this time. Please remember Jay as you remember him.</p>

Born on July 20, 2010, in Chadron, Nebraska, Jace&rsquo;s life was a testament to the power of joy, creativity, and the enduring strength of family bonds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;From his earliest days in Rushville, Jace displayed an unquenchable curiosity and zest for life that would become his hallmark. As he grew, he attended school through the eighth grade in Rushville and Hay Springs, Nebraska, where he was known for his loving nature and creative spirit. Jace was a bright light in the lives of his classmates and teachers, always eager to lend a helping hand and share a smile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Jace&#39;s passion for the great outdoors was evident to all who knew him. An avid hunter and outdoorsman, he found peace and excitement in the natural world. Whether he was stalking wildlife in the quiet of dawn or simply enjoying the solitude of the plains, Jace embraced the beauty around him. His love for music complemented his outdoor pursuits; Jace enjoyed playing and experimenting with all musical instruments, an interest that brought harmony to both his life and those around him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;A natural mechanic, Jace dedicated countless hours to working on machinery, ranching, and farming in Nebraska and South Dakota. His handy skills were not just a necessity but a joy, as he could often be found fixing what was broken or improving what already worked. Jace&rsquo;s knack for problem-solving and willingness to tackle any challenge were traits that endeared him to all in his community.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Jace&#39;s character was defined by his loving nature. He was a beacon of kindness and creativity, always thinking outside the box and approaching life with a warm heart. His family was the cornerstone of his world, and he cherished every moment spent with them. Jace leaves behind a legacy of love, as he is survived by his devoted parents, Quinten Scherbarth and Jeny Meyer; maternal grandparents, Vaughn and Lois Meyer; paternal grandparents, Allen and Ruthann Scherbarth; paternal great-grandmother, Maryann Wellnitz; three aunts; three uncles; and nine cousins, all of whom will miss him dearly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In the words of Helen Keller, &quot;What we have once enjoyed we can never lose; all that we love deeply becomes a part of us.&quot; Jace&#39;s spirit and the memories he created with his loved ones will forever be a part of the fabric of their lives. His influence will continue to be felt in the way his family and friends approach life with love and a can-do attitude.</p>

<p>&nbsp;As we bid farewell to Jace Keg Scherbarth, we celebrate the joy he brought into our lives and the many ways he touched our hearts. His journey on earth was brief, but the impact of his loving and creative soul will resonate for generations to come. We take comfort in knowing that Jace is now at peace, surrounded by the vast beauty he so adored in life, and that his legacy of kindness and ingenuity will forever be remembered by those who were fortunate enough to have known him.</p>

Gonzales, born on November 20, 1959, in San Juan, New Mexico, passed away peacefully of natural causes on March 3, 2025, in Rapid City, South Dakota. Known for his loving nature, kindness, and generosity, Michael's zest for life and hearty laughter left a mark on the hearts of all who knew him.</p><p>Michael's early years in San Juan laid the foundation for a life filled with hard work and strong family values. He was a man who learned life's lessons through experience, earning what he often joked was an """"Education of Hard Knocks."""" His work ethic was evident from a young age, starting with his first job at a local gas station where he was known for his diligence and handy skills at the pumps and fixing flat tires. Michael's career path led him to become an electrical apprentice for Doer Electric and later, he bravely worked on oil rigs until an injury curtailed his ability to continue in that line of work.</p><p>&nbsp;Despite the challenges he faced, Michael's spirit remained unbroken. He channeled his energy into the passions that brought joy to his life. His love for speed earned him the affectionate nicknames """"Speedy Gonzales"""" and """"Bear."""" He reveled in the thrill of driving fast cars, trucks, and motorcycles, each ride echoing his adventurous soul. A true son of New Mexico, Michael had an enduring love for the great outdoors, often found fishing or simply enjoying the tranquility of nature. His culinary tastes remained true to his roots, with a classic red chili with frijoles and a soft tortilla being among his favorite dishes.</p><p>Family was the cornerstone of Michael's world. He is survived by his two daughters, Christy Gonzales and Angellina (Moses) Chavez; his grandson, Marquis, who will forever treasure their playful memories; and his four sisters, Marquita (Joe) Earley, Pauline (Raymond) Aranda, Sheila (Lucky) Gonzales, Carolyn Gonzales and his only surviving uncle, Leonard (Alice) Gonzales. His extended family of nieces, nephews, great-nieces, and great-nephews will also hold his memory dear, each of them touched by his kindness and ever-present willingness to help.</p><p><br></p><p>He is preceded in death by his parents, Pablo and Lucy Gonzales and two brothers Carl and Chris Gonzales.</p><p>&nbsp;One of Michael's most cherished experiences was the simple joy of playing with his grandson Marquis on the playground. Like a """"baby bear climbing trees,"""" his laughter and playfulness were infectious, creating a bond and a memory that will endure for generations. This moment encapsulates the essence of Michael's spirit, a man who found profound happiness in life's simplest pleasures.</p><p>&nbsp;Faith played a significant role in Michael's life. His love for the Lord Jesus was unwavering, and he accepted Him fully into his heart. His favorite bible verse is Romans 10:13, For, """"whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."""" His passing was graced with the peace that comes from a well-lived life, and a faith deeply held.</p><p>&nbsp;Michael's legacy is a tapestry woven from the lives he touched, the love he shared, and the joy he brought to others. His infectious smile, generous heart, and the echoes of his laughter will remain with us, a comforting presence in the absence of the man who lived fully, loved deeply, and left this world better for his presence.</p><p>Michael's life was a testament to the power of love and the strength of the human spirit. As we say farewell to a beloved father, grandfather, brother, and friend, we take solace in knowing that his journey was rich with love and that he now rests in eternal.</p><p>Memorial services will take place 11:00 am Saturday, March 15, 2025 at Bloomfield Assembly of God, 211 E.

Giedd, a beacon of love and kindness, passed away peacefully of natural causes on March 8, 2025, in Rapid City, South Dakota, at the age of 75. Born on April 11, 1949, in Glendale, California, Joyce&#39;s life was a tapestry woven with the threads of love, friendship, and dedication.<br />
<br />
Joyce graduated from Adolfo Camarillo High School in Camarillo, California, where she was known for her warm spirit and friendly demeanor. After her schooling, she embarked on a career as a credit collector, a role in which she worked across California, Virginia, and South Dakota. Despite the challenges of her profession, Joyce was always recognized for her kindness and generosity, traits that endeared her to colleagues alike.<br />
<br />
In her personal life, Joyce was a devoted wife to her husband of 51 years, having exchanged vows on the memorable day of November 21, 1973. Their loving partnership was blessed with a daughter, Melissa Lucas, who brought immense joy to Joyce&#39;s life. Joyce&#39;s family was her pride and joy, and she dedicated herself to creating a warm and loving home.<br />
<br />
Joyce&#39;s creative spirit shone brightly through her love of sewing and cross-stitch, where she crafted masterpiece projects that were not only beautiful but also imbued with her love and care. Her artwork was a reflection of her inner beauty and her desire to create lasting memories.<br />
<br />
Known for her ability to cultivate deep and lasting relationships, Joyce cherished spending quality time with her family and friends. She was a gentle soul who could light up a room with her presence and whose friendship was a gift to those who knew her.<br />
<br />
Joyce is survived by her adoring husband, her beloved daughter Melissa, and a legacy of love that will continue to flourish in the hearts of those who knew her. She was preceded in death by her father, John Baker, and a sister, Teresa Schmidt, who both held special places in her heart.<br />
<br />
The words loving, kind, and friendly are not sufficient to capture the essence of Joyce, but they are a testament to the impact she had on everyone she met. As Mother Teresa once said, &quot;Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.&quot; Joyce embodied this sentiment, living a life rich in small acts of great love.<br />
<br />
Joyce&#39;s life was a journey of compassion and friendship, and her story will be told with fondness and admiration. As we say goodbye to Joyce A. Giedd, we celebrate the remarkable woman she was and the lives she touched with her extraordinary heart. Her memory will be cherished, and her spirit will live on as a guiding light to all who were blessed to know her.<br />

She was a beacon of love and generosity throughout her 83 years, touching the lives of many with her faith-filled spirit.</p>

<p>Ester grew up in Texas, where she completed her education through the eighth grade. From a young age, she assisted her mother, Modesta Alvarez, in caring for her siblings, perfecting her culinary skills and establishing a hard work ethic that would later serve her well in life. She carried these lessons of love and service throughout her life, always putting family first.</p>

<p>Ester ran two very successful Mexican restaurants, first in Texas and later in South Dakota. Ester met and married the love of her life, Oliver Leroy Oleson, with whom she shared 43 years of marriage. Ester&#39;s dedication extended beyond her business as she was a devoted wife, mother, and friend. Her home was a warm and welcoming place where all felt cherished and valued.</p>

<p>Ester&#39;s family was her pride and joy. She is survived by a loving daughter, Tami White; a loving son, Donny (Jenny) Powell; and her adored grandchildren, Jacob Russell, Jared Stenerson, Zion Powell, Kim (Alex) Mattson, Skye Rodriguez, Amy Powell, and Nikki Rodriguez. Her legacy continues through her eight great-grandchildren, who brought immense joy to her later years. She also leaves behind three brothers, Ruben Balderas, Chendo Saiz, and Terry Balderas, as well as many nieces and nephews; some of which she considered sons, Rafe Balderas, Carlos Martinez, Nicholas Balderas and Jesse Pierce who will cherish her memory.</p>

<p>Preceding her in death were her beloved husband, Oliver Leroy Oleson; her parents, Santiago Balderas, Sr. and Modesta Alvarez; her sister, Rafaela Balderas; and brothers, Ernest, Jesse, and Jimmy Balderas.</p>

<p>Ester&#39;s contributions to her community were significant. She was a proud member of the Grand River Chapter #162 Order of the Eastern Star, where she devoted several years of service. Her interests were a reflection of her love for life and her family. Ester was an exceptional cook, often found in the kitchen preparing meals that would become the centerpiece of family gatherings. She partnered with her husband on their family ranch in Harding County, South Dakota, where they built a life together. Sewing was another of Ester&#39;s passions, and she was an active member of the Sewing Guild for many years.</p>

<p>In her leisure time, Ester found pleasure in spoiling her great-grandchildren, listening to Mexican music, painting beautiful landscapes and portraits, and watching her favorite movies. Known for her fiery spirit, she famously enjoyed Serrano Peppers with every meal. Above all, Ester will be remembered as a loving and generous soul, whose faith was her guiding light.</p>

<p>A quote that Ester often shared with her family, attributed to Mother Teresa, encapsulates the philosophy she lived by: &quot;Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.&quot; This simple yet profound statement mirrored the way Ester approached every aspect of her life&mdash;with great love.</p>

1659001,Hao,,Fong,1970-05-14,2025-05-19,"<p>Dr. Hao Fong, PH. D., a cherished husband, father, brother, son, and esteemed scientist, passed away peacefully from natural causes on May 19, 2025, in Rapid City, South Dakota. Born on May 14, 1970, in Chuzhou, China, Hao&rsquo;s journey was one marked by dedication, compassion, and innovation. He leaves behind a legacy of love, learning, and a profound impact on the field of polymer science.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Dr. Fong immigrated to the United States to pursue his passion for science and earned his Ph.D. in Polymer Science from The University of Akron in Akron, Ohio. His academic achievements laid the foundation for a career that would see him recognized as a pioneer in the field. Dr. Fong was particularly known for his groundbreaking work in electrospinning techniques. As a leading researcher during his tenure at the South Dakota School of Mines in Rapid City, Dr. Fong&#39;s contributions significantly advanced the university&#39;s research enterprise and cemented his reputation as a visionary in his field.</p>

<p>&nbsp;His entrepreneurial spirit led him to co-found Nanapareil, a successful startup that emerged from his research efforts. This company not only marked a high point in his career but also brought innovative solutions to the industry, showcasing his ability to turn theory into practical, world-changing applications.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Dr. Fong&rsquo;s impact extended well beyond the laboratory. He was a mentor to a generation of students, guiding them through their master&rsquo;s and doctoral studies and shaping the futures of many young scientists. His commitment to education and his students was unwavering, and his influence will be felt for years to come. As a dedicated supporter of the Chinese Students and Scholar community at the university, he provided guidance and friendship to many who were far from home, helping to bridge cultures and foster understanding.</p>

<p>Dr. Fong was more than just a scientist; he was a man of great character. Known for his kindness, friendliness, and generosity, he touched the lives of all who knew him. He carried a song in his heart, often singing his favorite tunes and sharing his love for music with those around him. His love for badminton was matched only by his love for his family and friends, with whom he cherished spending quality time.</p>

<p>Dr. Fong lived by the philosophy that &quot;The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others,&rdquo; a quote famously attributed to Mahatma Gandhi. This sentiment was reflected in Hao&#39;s everyday actions and his commitment to helping others. He was a pillar in his community, known for his willingness to lend a hand and his unwavering support for those in need.</p>

<p>Dr. Hao Fong&#39;s departure from this world leaves a void in the hearts of those who loved him and in the scientific community that revered him. Yet, his spirit lives on in the memories shared, the knowledge imparted, and the lives he touched. As we say goodbye to this remarkable man, we celebrate a life well-lived&mdash;a life that serves as an inspiration to us all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In accordance with Hao&#39;s love for life and the natural world, his final resting place in the serene landscapes of Rapid City is a fitting tribute to a man who found beauty and purpose in the complex tapestry of existence. His family takes comfort in knowing that his legacy will continue to influence and inspire, just as the memories of his warm smile and generous spirit will forever be cherished in their hearts.</p>

Born in Buffalo, South Dakota, on July 31, 1940, to Reuben and Gladys Kaitfors-Kehrberg, Wally was a man known for his handy and creative spirit, as well as his adventurous soul.</p>

<p>Wally&#39;s early years were spent on the family ranch, where he not only helped with the daily operations but also discovered his love for music. He attended Dunn grade school and was a proud graduate of Belle Fourche High School, class of 1958. Throughout his life, Wally&#39;s work ethic was evident as he managed various endeavors, including running a trucking business and a backhoe and trenching company. His resilience shone through as he faced life&#39;s challenges, such as recovering from a significant back injury, which led him back to the ranch and eventually into various construction jobs until his well-deserved retirement.</p>

<p>Music was a constant joy in Wally&#39;s life. He played guitar and was the lead singer in a local band, where he was joined by his sister Shirley on bass guitar and his brother-in-law Penrod on steel guitar. Together, they provided the soundtrack for dances all over the area, leaving a legacy of melodies and memories.</p>

<p>Wally really enjoyed flying. He spent countless hours flying Penrod&#39;s airplane across the plains of South Dakota and Wyoming. He used the plane extensively on the ranch checking his cattle.</p>

<p>Wally&#39;s personal life was filled with love and devotion. He married Darlyn Zentner in 1973, and the couple was blessed with two daughters, Lori and Jennifer. Although Wally and Darlyn later divorced, the family bonds remained strong. He took great pride in his daughters and grandson, Austan, cherishing every moment spent with them.</p>

<p>In his later years, Wally enjoyed the simple pleasures of life: playing his guitar, engaging in thoughtful conversations with friends, and embracing the creativity that came naturally to him. His adventurous spirit never waned, and he approached each day with the same vigor and enthusiasm he had in his youth.</p>

His legacy will live on in the hearts of those who knew him, and his memory will continue to inspire us all.

Born on December 14, 1934, in Holden, Massachusetts, Robert&#39;s life was a testament to his loving, adventurous, and humorous spirit, which he maintained until his final days.<br />
<br />
Robert&#39;s early years were spent in the quaint town of Holden, where he received his education, graduating from Holden High School. He proudly served his country in the United States Air Force from 1957 until 1960, a period of his life that instilled in him a sense of discipline and camaraderie that he carried throughout his life. Following his military service, Robert embarked on a career as an appliance technician with Sears, a role he dedicated himself to for 15 years until his early retirement at 55. This allowed him the freedom to pursue his passion for travel and adventure, exploring far-flung destinations and the beauty of his own backyard in South Dakota.<br />
<br />
As a devout Christian, Robert&#39;s faith was a guiding light in his life, providing him with comfort and a community of fellow believers. His love for the outdoors was unparalleled; he was an avid fisherman and hunter, often found driving through the picturesque Black Hills, a place he considered a slice of heaven on earth. His dexterity with woodworking was admired by many at the Canyon Lake Senior Citizens Center Wood Working Club, where he spent many happy hours crafting and socializing.<br />
<br />
Robert&#39;s sense of humor and love for games, especially Cribbage, brought joy and laughter to those around him. He was a familiar and beloved face at the local senior center, where his quick wit and good-natured ribbing were as much a part of the fabric of the community as the games themselves.<br />
<br />
He leaves behind a legacy of love and laughter with his two daughters, Shelly (Todd) Jones of Victor, Idaho and Audrey (Roy) Monnot, and his son, Larry (Cami) Berube, all of whom reside in the warmth of Rapid City. His brothers, Jim, Eddie, and Tom Berube, will remember him as a beacon of brotherly love and camaraderie. Robert&#39;s seven grandchildren, Shane, Desiree, Mindy, Brandi, Reba, Kai, and Cam, along with his four great-grandchildren, will carry forward the tales of his adventures and the echoes of his laughter.<br />
<br />

<br />
In the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, &quot;It is not the length of life, but the depth of life.&quot; Robert Allen Berube indeed lived a life of remarkable depth, touching the hearts of those he met with his infectious joy and boundless love.<br />
<br />
His memory will be cherished, his stories retold, and his life celebrated by all who were fortunate enough to know him. Robert&#39;s journey through life was an inspiration, and his memory will be a treasure held dear in the hearts of his family and friends forever.<br />

<p>Baird&rsquo;s early years were marked by both joy and tragedy; he was born exactly one year<br />
after his sister, Sue Ellen, who lived for only 24 hours. His parents, Harry Baird Niceley,<br />

years later, the family grew with the arrival of his younger brother, Mark, completing the<br />
family circle.<br />

grace. His friends and family will remember him as the embodiment of the well-known<br />
quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson: To laugh often and much; to win the respect of<br />
intelligent people and the affection of children... to leave the world a bit better... to know<br />

Baird indeed succeeded, touching lives with his enduring kindness and warm, friendly<br />
nature.</p>

lived with intention, loved with generosity, and laughed with his whole heart. As we bid<br />

He exemplified this commandment through his actions, always placing the needs of others above his own and extending a helping hand wherever it was needed.</p>

<p>Barry&#39;s interests were as vast as the South Dakota sky. He delighted in the great outdoors, spending his leisure time camping under the stars, boating on serene lakes, hunting in the crisp autumn air, and fishing in the tranquil waters.

1676306,Darcy,Lynn,Hart,1957-10-25,2025-10-08,"<p>Darcy Lynn Hart, beloved husband, father, son, brother, and friend, passed away peacefully October 8, 2025. He was born on October 25, 1957, in Mitchell, South Dakota, to Manly and Marlene Hart. He grew up alongside his younger sister, Candee (Hart) Reed.</p>

<p>Darcy was raised in Mitchell, where he attended the Wesleyan Church and developed a deep love for horses while training and selling them with his father. He graduated from Mitchell High School in 1976 and soon set out to chase his dreams out West.</p>

<p>His journey led him to Cody, Wyoming, where he pursued his passion for bull riding and rodeo life. He worked on ranches and guided elk hunts, immersing himself in the cowboy lifestyle. From there, Darcy moved to Greybull, Wyoming, where he continued ranching, trained chariot horses, and raced them.</p>

<p>Later, Darcy moved to Florida, where he trained racehorses and, true to his adventurous spirit, also spent time roping alligators and hog hunting. In 1988, he returned to his home state, living briefly in Sioux Falls before settling in Piedmont, South Dakota, with his parents. There, he continued working with horses&mdash;training, selling, roping, and shoeing them&mdash;and worked at High Plains Genetics.</p>

<p>It was in the Piedmont and Rapid City area that Darcy met the love of his life, Kathy. They were married for 27 wonderful years and made their home together, raising two children, Jordan and Jean, who were the light of Darcy&rsquo;s life. A devoted and loving father, he took great pride in everything his children did.</p>

<p>Together, Darcy and Kathy owned and operated Smokin 44 Arena, where they hosted numerous team roping events. Darcy deeply cherished the time spent at these events&mdash;rodeo, horses, and community were at the heart of his life. Over the years, they raised and trained many outstanding performance horses.</p>

<p>Most recently, Darcy, Kathy, and their son Jordan launched&nbsp;Hanging Hart Performance Horses&mdash;a new family-run venture built on a lifetime of horsemanship and a shared vision for the future. It was a project close to Darcy&rsquo;s heart, blending his legacy with the next generation.</p>

<p>For the past 18 years, Darcy worked for Brink Construction, hauling heavy equipment&mdash;a job he took great pride in, as he did with everything, he put his hands to.</p>

<p>Darcy truly wore many hats, literally and figuratively. Whether it was a cowboy hat or a ball cap, he filled each role in life with integrity, hard work, and heart. He had a story for every occasion and a passion for every season of life. When he committed to something, he gave it his all.</p>

<p>Despite his rough, calloused hands, Darcy had a soft and faithful heart. His relationship with Christ was the foundation of his life. He was a loyal member of the Wesleyan Church in Mitchell, later attending churches in Sturgis and Rapid City, and for the past six years, Lifeway Church. He was passionate about his faith and loved to invite others to experience it with him.</p>

<p>Darcy&#39;s passing leaves a deep void, but his legacy lives on through his faith, his family, and the countless lives he touched.</p>

<p>He is survived by his loving wife, Kathy Hart; his children, Jordan and Jean; his mother, Marlene Hart; his sister, Candee Reed and her husband, Kel; and many extended family members and friends.</p>

<p>Darcy has gone home to be with the Lord, leaving behind the words of Proverbs 27:17 as a reflection of his life:<br />
&ldquo;As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Lord has gained a great cowboy.</p>

<p>A private burial will be attended by immediate family to fulfill Darcy&rsquo;s wishes. A celebration of life will be held at Lifeway Church in Rapid City on October 25th at 11:00 AM. Lunch will be provided after the ceremony.</p>

<p>A memorial has been established.</p>

1676644,Michael,Joy,Carter,1952-10-11,2025-10-16,"<p>Michael Joy Carter, a cherished pillar of his community and a beacon of love<br />
and generosity, was called to his eternal home on October 16, 2025, in Rapid<br />
City, South Dakota. Born on October 11, 1952, in Fostoria, Ohio, Mike lived a<br />
life characterized by unwavering faith, an entrepreneurial spirit, and a deep<br />
devotion to his family and friends.<br />
Raised in the town of his birth, Mike graduated from Fostoria High School,<br />
where he laid the foundation of hard work and integrity that would define his<br />
personal and professional life. His commitment to these virtues was evident to<br />
all who had the pleasure of knowing him. After decades of dedicated service<br />
in his career, Mike embraced his passion for numismatics by opening Mike&#39;s<br />
Coins in his retirement years. His coin shop quickly became more than a<br />
business: it was a gathering place for those who shared his enthusiasm and a<br />
testament to his belief in the value of community and fellowship.<br />
Mike&#39;s life was a living example of his Christian faith, and his actions spoke<br />
the love and teachings of Christ. As it is written, &quot;Whatever you do, work<br />
heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,&quot; (Colossians 3:23), Mike embodied<br />
this scripture through his sincere approach to life and business. He treated<br />
everyone he encountered with a level of kindness and respect that left a<br />
lasting impression.<br />
His family was the cornerstone of his existence. He is survived by his<br />
daughter, Joy Sheffer, and her family, Kendra, Shae, Garrett, and Dalton; his<br />
son, Mike &quot;Joe&quot;, and his children, Emily, Erica, Michael, and Mitchell. His legacy of<br />
love also lives on through his sister Pam Myers and her daughter Tammy; his<br />
sister Brenda Cipiti and her husband Jeff; his brother Kevin Carter and Kevin&rsquo;s<br />
son KC; and his sister-in-law Debbie Carter, wife of his late brother Steve.<br />
Mike was preceded in death by his parents, Donald and Josephine Carter, his<br />
sister Lori Carter, and his brother Steve Carter.<br />
Mike&#39;s love for the great outdoors was evident in his joy of riding his scooter<br />
through the Badlands National Park, where he felt a deep connection with<br />
God&#39;s creation. His interest in rare coins was not only a hobby but a shared<br />
journey with fellow enthusiasts, as he guided many in the discovery and<br />
appreciation of these historical treasures.</p>

<p>Those who knew Mike would describe him as loving, generous, and<br />
thoughtful&mdash;a man who never missed an opportunity to help others or offer a<br />
kind word. His legacy is not only in the coins he cherished but in the<br />
immeasurable value of the relationships he nurtured.<br />
As we honor the life of Michael Joy Carter, we are reminded of the words of<br />
Mahatma Gandhi, &quot;The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the<br />
service of others;&quot; Mike found himself through his service and love for his<br />
family, friends, and community. His memory will be treasured, and his light will<br />
continue to shine in the hearts of those who loved him.<br />
A celebration of life will be scheduled at a later date. In lieu of flowers, the<br />
family requests donations be made to Mike&#39;s Coins, 406 Cedar Street Apt<br />
301, Monticello, MN 55362 to benefit the local youth.</p>
