When he worked in the ND oil fields, we managed to meet up a couple of times and catch up. He was the type of person who made everyone else feel comfortable and at ease with his good vibes.

Lots of people are imaginative thinkers; Don was an imaginative doer. He used to drop in at my office, asking ""Got a few minutes?"" Hours later I would know some details about his next great project: a giant Ferris Wheel on Presidents' Plaza, high enough to see Mt. Rushmore from afar; a majestic walkway/arch across Omaha Street, similar to the St. Louis arch, to link the two halves of our bifurcated city; a novel plan to provide cradle-to-grave health care to every American, backed by an expensive actuarial study for which he paid; a replica of Philadelphia's Independence Hall, located on the way to Mt. Rushmore; an electronic message board to be mounted on cars, to facilitate human contact. And of course the visionary ""City of Presidents"" Project, which has transformed our city. Some of these ideas soared. Some fizzled. No matter, there was always another one arising from his fertile mind, conveyed with excitement and enthusiasm. Almost always, my initial view of these ideas was skeptical, as is my nature. Almost always, before our conversation was over he had converted me, as was his nature.

One was from when he asked if I would help put wood shingles on his two-story home.  At age 17, I naively said I would.  He offered to pay us $4/hr. - more than minimum wage at the time.  I had a few second thoughts as I carried bundles of shingles up on scaffolding and onto the roof.  I ended up enjoying the work, carrying a hammer and carpenter's pouch full of nails, and was proud to be part of the project once we were done.  It increased my confidence to do something out of my comfort zone.  John was consistently encouraging and good-natured despite outworking all of us.  A second memory is of John asking me to join him on morning runs when I was 17 or 18.  What I didn't realize is that John actually meant morning races.  As we ran along, faster and faster, I wondered what John was up to.  We ended up sprinting down what seemed like an endless stretch of path across from my house.  This was during a time that John wanted to run ""40 (minutes in the 10K) at (age) 40.""  I believe he accomplished his goal - as he accomplished many goals - with a lot of hard work, optimism, and determination.

We always found ways to have an adventure; misadventures might be the more accurate word. Whichever the term, we never failed to have a great time whenever we got together. We spent so many hours just being kids, roaming the hills and woods around his house, playing in the old barn until he fell through the hay loft floor and caught himself with his arms before he fell to the bottom level. Or when he locked me in that rabbit cage and wouldn't let me out. Or when we took joy rides in his dad's Datsun station wagon, or when we tried our hand at making elderberry wine by grinding the berries up in a meat grinder and putting the juice in coffee cans and waited months for them to turn into wine. It was a classic fail, maybe because we didn't realize sugar was an important part of the recipe. We didn't add that. The purple stain on the wood floor of the old house was a dead giveaway to his dad what we had been up to. I'll miss your presence, and the many comments we shared on Facebook. Love you Cuz.

The first time I saw Tripp as a baby I immediately thought ""Wow, he is a Smoot!""   Dark hair and brown penetrating eyes that sparkled.  Each time we ran into each other we did a LOT of laughing and catching up .  He was a true free spirit who followed his own drum beat like so many.  I will always remember him as a special cousin who entertained us all, regaling us with stories of his travels and shenanigans.  I love you Trip....rest in peace.",0,0,

We spent most of our time riding bikes and hanging out at each other’s houses. We would hang out together so often that my mom would even refer to him as her third son. Some of my memories include dressing up on Halloween like Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee. Mike was Nikki. We even drew their tattoos on each other with permanent markers. When he lived in the country, we made a bike track through his grove of trees.  We had bottle rocket fights where we would hold the rockets in our hands and shoot them at each other. We put my car into the ditch more than a couple of times driving on his gravel road. He loved running track, especially the 400 and would talk about his strategy regularly. He loved car stereos and could talk your ear off about what is new and what is the best way to set things up. Mike drove my 1961 Dodge Seneca to the senior prom and must have shown it off a lot because I got a ton of comments about my car the next week at school. When Mike was stationed in Las Vegas while in the Air Force, I went to visit him during spring break. I had just turned 21 and he was still 20. He borrowed his roommate’s old military ID so we could hit some clubs. After waiting in line at the first place we went to, as soon as we got to the door, the bouncer took a long look at his ID and kicked us out while keeping the ID so we weren’t able to hit the town. A few years later, Mike was the best man at my wedding. The next year, I was his best man. Unfortunately, by this time we were living a ways apart and busy raising families so we had a hard time staying in touch as much as we wanted. My wife and I always treasured the time that we got to spend with Mike and Amanda. I will miss Mike dearly, but he will never fade from my memories.

In conversation, she informed me that Vaun had passed on. On his phone list, Vaun had listed us as Doctor Dave and Lori, even though I am not a doctor, but a Heart and Lung technical specialist. My wife Lori and I were on our honeymoon, July 2016, and traveling to Mount Rushmore when we happened upon Boyds antique store. We created an instant friendship with our similar addiction to antiques, uniques, and a huge collection of vintage things, that I continue collecting to this day at age 65. We purchased a few items, but Vaun gave us a couple of 'wedding' gifts to remember him by and which we still have, one of which was a model of a 1949 Ford Woody station wagon (picture in obituary photos). Now, I own a real 1950 Ford convertible and a 1951 Ford Victoria. Vaun even took the time to show us his 'unseen and off-limits' collection of goodies! I am honored to say that Vaun gave us, as newlyweds, our first antique/unique items, in our now very large collection. We are Truly Blessed and Happy to have made a friendship so effortlessly and rapidly in just moments! We will never forget Vaun, his wealth of knowledge, hospitality, interest in us, and charismatic, kind, friendly demeanor! God Bless Vaun for being such a Wonderful example of Goodness.

We will truly miss her next week, but I know she is in heaven with her parents and my parents now and she will celebrate with them! <br>Some of my favorite memories are playing with her Barbie Dreamhouse when we were little girls at her slumber parties and playing the guitar together at church on Sundays! She was the organizer of all the party activities with our friends! The most memorable was when we turned 50 and went to Hawaii together! We also met in Vegas to celebrate Jimmy Buffett as a parrot head! I visited her often when she lived in Minneapolis and the Black Hills and we did many touristy activities together! We would meet in Sioux Falls or Omaha once a year to shop for scrapbooking items and eat a nice meal and of course, have a margarita!<br>Even though she never made it to San Diego to go to the Rose Bowl parade with me or the beach, I brought a little bit of the beach to her every year! She was my savior, when I was going through my divorce and helped me through a lot of teacher work drama!

I knew him when I was young, I’d say age 8-12 or so, over 40 years ago. He was always cool in my eyes. He was very much loved by my family, including Aunt Leslie (Wilhelm) Keltner, Mick, Jim, and Rick Wilhelm, and my parents Larry and Rita Burr (Wilhelm). Even after all of these years it sure was sad to hear of his passing. Many blessings to you all. May you find comfort in God’s love and memories of Darcy.",0,0,
